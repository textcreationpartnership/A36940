            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Candid and Chriſtian READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou art here preſented with ſome <hi>Sips</hi> of <hi>Chriſts, ſtreaming</hi> through a poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If thou expect any <hi>puddle</hi> in them (as ſure thou mayeſt) its by reaſon of the <hi>polluted breaſt</hi> through which they came, for the fountaine was cleare. Its our miſery that <hi>pure flowings forth from Chriſt,</hi> become <hi>impure</hi> in their paſſage through us: As the water, which in its fountaine was as <hi>cleare</hi> as <hi>Chriſtall,</hi> becomes <hi>muddy</hi> in its courſe through ſome <hi>kennell.</hi> I wiſh I were ſenſible enough of what a filthy kennell my heart is. Sure I am, if there be any <hi>clearneſſe</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102972:3"/>in what is offered, its not mine, but <hi>Chriſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twas a rainy day in which thoſe thoughts were brought forth. My owne heart needed ſome reſreſhing; and Chriſts Spirit brought that Text to my hands, which is treated of in this Diſcourſe. Concerning which, I have this to ſay.</p>
            <p>If thou <hi>expect ſtrong meat,</hi> tis not here: All that <hi>I</hi> pretend to (and oh that I may attaine that!) is to give <hi>milke to babes.</hi> If free grace have dignified me with that <hi>worthy name (Beleever.)</hi> I muſt adde to it this Epithite <hi>(weake.)</hi> Being ſuch I ſo ſpake: And (as our Proverb is) <hi>I meaſured others corne by my owne buſhell.</hi> I thought ſome might be as I was, and am, <hi>weak:</hi> And if thou art <hi>ſtrong,</hi> I have nothing to ſay to thee but this; <hi>Be not high minded, but feare:</hi> Even the <hi>men</hi> in Chriſt, ſometimes are as the <hi>children,</hi> weake. But if thou be either <hi>habitually or
<pb facs="tcp:102972:3"/>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally</hi> weake: here is a <hi>Sip</hi> for thee, I promiſe no more: Neither wilt thou finde ſo much, if Chriſt doe not undertake (which I have deſired and doe) to make my promiſe good.</p>
            <p>That which incouraged me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in <hi>Print,</hi> was this hope, that as Chriſt had made this, ſome way, ſweet in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> ſo he would alſo make it in the <hi>Preſſe.</hi> Some <hi>Lambs</hi> of Chriſt were refreſhed in the <hi>preaching</hi> of this: and that made me hope, that ſome others might alſo be refreſhed by its <hi>peruſall.</hi> I muſt proclaime it to the glory of free grace, that my owne ſoul hath taſted ſome ſweetneſſe by what Chriſt gave in to mee in this Treatiſe: And becauſe I would not <hi>eat my morſells alone,</hi> I was the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger to this worke of publiſhing.</p>
            <p>If I might be a meanes to give a <hi>Sip of conſolation</hi> to ſome <hi>weake Beleever,</hi> I have my <hi>reward</hi> in this, and encouragement to the like.</p>
            <p>Its Chriſts peculiar <hi>Prerogative</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102972:4"/>(and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> would not pretend unto it) <hi>to have dominion over faith:</hi> Tis hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for any (too much for me) to be counted helping of his peoples joy. I have alwayes feared that <hi>Kingly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evill,</hi> which I ſee <hi>ſwell</hi> under the throats of ſome; while they rather <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially</hi> preſſe things upon peoples conſciences, then <hi>Miniſterially</hi> helpe beleevers comforts. To this laſt I have aimed, and if I obtaine it not, I confeſſe I have miſſed my marke.</p>
            <p>I have ſtudied to be above <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> therefore I ſhall not print <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,</hi> otherwiſe I might ſigh and ſay, that I knew what <hi>David</hi> meant, when he ſaid, <hi>his ſoule was among Lions, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. <hi>57.4.</hi> Some have beene ſo <hi>weake</hi> as to <hi>deny,</hi> others <hi>worſe,</hi> to endeavour to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> my <hi>Miniſtery:</hi> But Chriſt (whom I bleſſe, <hi>who inabled me, for that he counted me faithfull, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me into the Miniſtery</hi>) hath
<pb facs="tcp:102972:4"/>ſweetned my endeavours, by cauſing ſome of his ſheep <hi>(who know his voyce)</hi> to owne my Miniſtery, and vindicate me from being a <hi>ſtranger.</hi> Its my humble hope, that if thou be a <hi>Lambe of Chriſt,</hi> thou wilt in this (though through an oaten reed) <hi>heare his voice;</hi> which (if thou doe) follow it.</p>
            <p>When I ſhall underſtand, that what is now Printed, either pleaſes, or profits any poor beleeving ſoul, I ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to publiſh ſomething beſides, of the like nature to this, <hi>viz. The ſweetneſſe of Chriſts carriage to beleevers under temptations:</hi> And alſo the <hi>tenderneſſe of his heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards beleevers, with reference to their ignorance, unbeleefe, and inability to act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At preſent I have done, when I have intreated thee (Reader) to pray for me, that I may finde <hi>grace</hi> to be <hi>faithfull,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome</hi> to be <hi>skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> in feeding the <hi>Lambs</hi> of Chriſt,

            <p>If thou in this be my <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer</hi> to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> thou wilt doe an <hi>office of charity</hi> for, and lay an <hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>ſervice</hi> upon him, who is,</p>

                  <hi>and tender toward theſe.</hi> I ſhall (if God will) in a particular Tract ſhew it, with reference to each of theſe ſorts, by declaring that Chriſt <hi>[is] ſweet,</hi> and <hi>[how]</hi> to thoſe whoſe <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> is but <hi>weake</hi> and <hi>little;</hi> onely from this Text, I ſhall hold it out in a generall way, how <hi>Chriſts carriage,</hi> is tender towards all theſe, and ſuch as are thus, for (at leaſt) diſtinctions ſake, <hi>habitually weake;</hi> whom the Prophet calls his <hi>Lambs</hi> in this place.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt carries himſelfe very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly towards his weake Lambs, is that he will gather them. Lambs,</hi> all the flock are but <hi>weake,</hi> and ſo apt to <hi>wander,</hi> if not looked to. Now Chriſt he will
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102972:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>gather,</hi> and that with much care (for ſo the word ſignifies) his poor <hi>weake</hi> members, that are apt to <hi>wander.</hi> Chriſt, thou <hi>(poore weakling)</hi> will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look to thee.

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.176.</note> will Chriſt ſeek me?

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſts carriage is very tender, for he will carry thoſe that cannot goe.</hi> The <hi>weake Lamb</hi> lyes downe, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe; the <hi>Shepherd</hi> takes it up, and <hi>bears</hi> it.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The carriage of Chriſt is diſcovered to be tenderly ſweet to weake beleevers, in that <hi>he cheriſheth and preſerveth thoſe little buddings of grace that are in them.</hi> Oh! ſaith the weake beleever, my <hi>fire</hi> is ſo litle (ſuch a <hi>litle ſparke</hi> in ſo many <hi>aſhes</hi>) that I feare 'twill <hi>out.</hi> My <hi>candle</hi> gives ſo <hi>litle</hi> light (and burnes ſo weakly in ſuch mighty winds,) that I doubt I ſhall be in the <hi>darke:</hi> my <hi>pulſe</hi> beats ſo <hi>faintly</hi> (there is ſuch <hi>little vitall ſtrength</hi> under ſo many <hi>mortall</hi> ſinnes) that I thinke I ſhall ere long <hi>give up the ghoſt,</hi> and dye. But ſtay <hi>weake</hi> ſoules! why ſay ye thus? Chriſt is <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>tender;</hi> what he hath begun, he will preſerve. Thy <hi>ſpark</hi> of fire ſhall not be <hi>extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> thy <hi>dim light</hi> ſhall not be <hi>blown out;</hi> thy <hi>weake</hi> life ſhall not <hi>decay.</hi> No, No, Chriſt will preſerve, maintaine, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh theſe true (though <hi>weake</hi>) begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of grace that are in thee. 'Twas the Prieſts office to keep the <hi>fire</hi> in the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> from going out. And 'tis Chriſts worke to doe the ſame in thy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102972:18"/>ſoule. Chriſt is this <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and that <hi>ſpirituall ſparke of fire,</hi> which God from above hath laid upon thy heart (the <hi>altar</hi>) in the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of thy ſoule, he will looke to, that it goe not out. Though thou be <hi>fearfull,</hi> remember Chriſt is <hi>faithfull;</hi> he will be tender of thee, and thou ſhalt finde his carriage <hi>ſweet,</hi> in <hi>cheriſhing thoſe weake graces that are in thee. Maries faith</hi> was very <hi>feeble;</hi> and when ſhe was ſecking <hi>ſorrowfully</hi> her Lord in the garden,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> her faith was like to fire that is going out; yet ſhe ſeems to <hi>doubt</hi> whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> were <hi>God,</hi> and able to raiſe himſelfe, and ſpeaks as if he were but <hi>Man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> and that ſome had <hi>ſtolne him away.</hi> Sir (ſaith ſhe) if thou haſt <hi>borne him hence</hi> (as if Chriſt could not goe without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying) <hi>tell me where thou haſt laid him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> and <hi>I will take him away</hi> (as if ſhe were ſtronger then he;) <hi>Maries</hi> faith you ſee is weake: ſurely this <hi>ſparke</hi> will out, if not preſently <hi>blowne:</hi> why marke now, Chriſt diſcovers himſelfe to be <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>tender;</hi> and therefore that he might <hi>cheriſh</hi> her faith in him, he ſpeaks to her, <hi>Mary.</hi> The like car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage you ſee in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. towards
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102972:18"/>thoſe <hi>weake</hi> Diſciples, who diſcourſe doubtingly concerning his <hi>Deity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> and begin to ſpeake, as if they queſtioned, whether he were the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> the Redeemer, yea or no. Their <hi>faith</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to <hi>flag</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Wee truſted it had been he, that ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Iſrael; and beſides all this, to day is the third day ſince theſe things</hi> ver. 20. <hi>were done. Weake hearts;</hi> three dayes delay makes them diſtruſt; ſurely their faith is almoſt out. But marke, how ſweetly Chriſt ſpeakes (indeed <hi>ver.</hi> 25. he checks their doubting, as arguing <hi>folly;</hi> and though their heart was ſincere,<note place="margin">See v. 26, 27.</note> he intimates 'twas but <hi>ſlow</hi> to <hi>beleeve,</hi> &amp;c. yet) he cheriſheth and preſerveth their faith from dying; and carries himſelfe very tenderly in arguing from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to keep their faith alive. That place in the Prophet diſcovers Chriſt as ſweetly carefull to preſerve the leaſt <hi>buds</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> in his, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, as the new wine is found in the cluſter, as one ſaith, deſtroy it not, for a bleſsing is in it, ſo will I doe for my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſake.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Calvin in locum.</note> How ever ſome ſeem to carry the meaning of this place, as if
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102972:19"/>it related to Gods ſparing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the righteous, while he is puniſhing the wicked; yet I think, we are rather to underſtand it, as relating to the tenderneſſe of Gods carriage, for Chriſts ſake, to elect <hi>Iſrael.</hi> God found them indeed weake. Rather as having wine in them <hi>potentially,</hi> then as being wine <hi>actually,</hi> as the <hi>wine</hi> in the <hi>cluster, i.e.</hi> they had ſome few faint buddings of grace: And Chriſt ſaid (for he was that <hi>One</hi>) <q>
                     <hi>Doe not deſtroy it Father, there is a bleſſing in it; though it be but yet weake, 'twill in time be ſtrong: cheriſh it, preſerve it, there is a bleſſing in it.</hi>
                  </q> You ſee Chriſt is very tender over his weake members. He is carefull to preſerve their bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, their buds. <hi>Take us the foxes, the little foxes that ſpoyle the vines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>for the vines have tender grapes,</hi> Cant. 2.15. Chriſt will have a <hi>tender care</hi> of che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the <hi>tender graces,</hi> that he ſees in weake beleevers.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, Chriſt diſcovers a ſweet carriage not only in preſerving the weake beginnings of grace, in the hearts of beleevers, but alſo in <hi>ſtrengthning their weakneſſe every day.</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102972:19"/>Its note-worthy, that Chriſt doth not onely <hi>not breake the bruiſed reeds,</hi> nor <hi>quench the ſmoaking flaxes, i.e.</hi> cheriſh the faint graces which are in feeble Saints, but he ſtrengthens &amp; increaſes them. He makes an augmentation, <hi>brings forth judgement unto truth, Eſa.</hi> 42.3. The meaning is ſaith (Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>That the gracious frame of holineſſe, ſet up in our hearts by the Spirit of Chriſt, ſhall goe forward, or increaſe, till all contrary power be brought downe.</hi> My feet (ſaith the poore ſoul) are ſo <hi>feeble,</hi> that I am ready to <hi>ſtumble</hi> at every <hi>ſtraw.</hi> Sure, I ſhall never be able to <hi>ſtride</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>log,</hi> to goe over a <hi>mountaine.</hi> Doubt not, <hi>O thou of little faith.</hi> Chriſt will carry himſelfe tender towards thee; and though thy feet be now weake as <hi>Lambs</hi> feet, that thou art ſcarce able to goe over a <hi>mole-hill,</hi> without ſliding, he will make them ſtrong as <hi>Hindes</hi> feet, that thou ſhalt be able (ere long) to leap over a <hi>mountaine. He maketh my feet like hindes feet,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.33. Chriſt is very carefull to carry on the ſoule from <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>ſtrength, Pſal.</hi> 84.7. He therefore <hi>gave</hi> ſome <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102972:20"/>
                  <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. that they might be for the <hi>perfecting of the Saints;</hi> that <hi>weake</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers who are but <hi>Infants,</hi> may grow <hi>ſtronger</hi> and <hi>ſtronger,</hi> till they come to <hi>mens</hi> age, as tis <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. Ah ſaith the poore ſoule, <hi>my light is but little; will it ere be bright.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Tis but as the dawning of the day. I thinke the day of grace is riſen in my ſoule, but 'tis but glimmering as the early morne, will it ere ſhine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly? ſhall it ever be noone? ſhall it be in my boſome as the Sunne in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian? will it ever riſe ſo high? Yes poore ſoule;</hi> ſtay a <hi>little,</hi> and it will be <hi>lighter.</hi>
                  </q> The <hi>path of the righteous is as the ſhining light, and ſhineth more and more to the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.28. Chriſt will make it <hi>day</hi> and a <hi>perfect day</hi> in thy heart; though it be <hi>morning</hi> now, and but even <hi>Sun riſing.</hi> Oh how ſweet is Chriſts carriage to his weake mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers! that thus he ſtrengthens their weake graces every day. He will cheriſh thee <hi>O beleeving babe,</hi> till thou <hi>grow bigger, in his boſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, weake beleevers have found Chriſts carriage very ſweet, in that <hi>he hath borne with thoſe many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which he hath found in them.</hi> Weak
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102972:20"/>ſoules are apt to <hi>ſlip,</hi> and Chriſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſmiles,</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe <hi>ſlips.</hi> Lambs are feeble, and ſometimes they fall, but the ſhepherd paſſes it by. Chriſt rather <hi>pities</hi> his members for their <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> then <hi>caſts them off. Peter</hi> was <hi>weake</hi> in refuſing Chriſts tender of <hi>waſhing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13.</note> But Chriſt was <hi>ſweet;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> he knew <hi>Peter</hi> was rather <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> then <hi>obſtinate.</hi> Chriſt tells him (and in that excuſeth his weakneſſe) that he did not know what his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was in that action; <hi>What I doe thou doſt not know,</hi> and therefore though <hi>Peter carryed</hi> himſelf <hi>weakly,</hi> in refuſing the waſhing; yet Chriſt <hi>carried</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>ſweetly,</hi> and paſſing by that <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> comes and <hi>waſheth</hi> his feet.<note place="margin">Cant. 1, 2.3.</note> 'Twas an infirmity of largeſt allowance in the Spouſe, to put off Chriſt with ſuch a poore excuſe after he ſtood ſo long waiting, <hi>I have put off my coat.</hi> Childiſh, as if ſhe could not put it on againe: And becauſe ſhe could not riſe to let him in; Chriſt muſt go away in the <hi>morning,</hi> though he had ſtood knocking all <hi>night.</hi> Yet Chriſt bears all. And (though the <hi>Spouſe</hi> might feare, he would take the buſineſſe ſo hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102972:21"/>as never more to come to her houſe) he came againe afterward. Indeed he permitted ſome <hi>lordly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to whip her for her <hi>lazy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> (and it was kindneſſe thus to fetch it out) But carried himſelfe <hi>tender</hi> ſtill,<note place="margin">Chap. 6.2, 3.</note> and admitted her into his <hi>garden ſweetly,</hi> albeit ſhe kept him out of her <hi>houſe ſluggiſhly.</hi> Surely <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> failed much, to <hi>ſleepe</hi> while their Lord <hi>ſorrowed;</hi> and not to regard his ſorrow, though he choſe them out (as it were) on purpoſe, to watch with him. Indeed, Chriſt <hi>ſighs</hi> to ſee them ſo <hi>weake,</hi> as not to be able to <hi>watch with him one houre;</hi> yet he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries himſelfe <hi>ſweet,</hi> and inſtead of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their <hi>unwatchfulneſſe,</hi> he excuſeth their <hi>weakneſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.41</note> The <hi>ſpirit is willing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but the fleſh is weake.</hi> Our children ſometimes doe faults, break glaſſes, &amp;c. but we ſay, alas poore hearts, 'twas their weakneſſe. Chriſts children are as weake as ours; onely he is kinder to his, then we can be to ours. He beares with more infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and paſſeth by more faults then we doe or can. Poore <hi>Thomas</hi> is very <hi>weake,</hi> hee'l not beleeve except he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102972:21"/>may open Chriſts wounds afreſh, and <hi>put his fingers in the print of the nailes.</hi> Chriſt is very <hi>ſweet,</hi> beares with all this, and is willing to have his wounds opened afreſh, to helpe <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> his faith;<note place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> ſurely <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaw Chriſts heart through his wounds; <hi>I will put in my fingers,</hi> ſaith <hi>Thomas, or elſe I will not beleeve,</hi> v. 25. Ah <hi>poor weake ſoule! come and thruſt them into my ſide</hi> (ſaith Chriſt:) Oh tender Saviour!<note place="margin">V. 27.</note> ſurely Chriſt will <hi>puniſh</hi> me (ſaith the poore ſoule) I am ſo <hi>wicked.</hi> No, Chriſt (poore heart) will <hi>pity</hi> thee, becauſe thou art ſo <hi>weake.</hi> Ah Lord! how many <hi>frailties, infirmities,</hi> nay <hi>inormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> doſt thou paſſe by in thy poore weake <hi>Lambs?</hi> verily thou carrieſt thy ſelfe like a tender, loving, ſweet ſhepherd towards us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Its eaſie to diſcover in Chriſts carriage, much ſweetneſſe and tenderneſſe to weake beleevers, in that <hi>he puts them upon no duties above their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> As he will not permit them to <hi>be tempted above their abilitie,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. ſo neither doth he put them upon any buſineſſe which is above their power. Though Chriſt hath many workes,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102972:22"/>about which he will put his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet he will tarry till they are able for them. <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you,</hi> but ye cannot <hi>beare them now,</hi> Jo. 16.12. Becauſe they were not able to beare, Chriſt was not willing to ſpeake. <q>
                     <hi>Alas, I ſee great works to be done, hard leſſons to be learned; ſure I ſhall never be able to doe that one, or learn the other, ſaith the weake ſoule, at leaſt, not yet; for I am but a babe, very weake:</hi>
                  </q> why, Chriſt is content to ſtay till thou ſhalt be ſtronger. As yet thou art <hi>unable,</hi> and as yet he is <hi>unwilling.</hi> Faſting, it was a weighty worke; and Chriſts diſciples were as yet but weake: He therefore forbears them, and puts them not upon it. And when ſome wondred (who indeed knew not the weight of the worke) that <hi>Chriſts diſciples ſafted not at all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 5.33.</note> 
                  <hi>when Jeſus did often,</hi> Chriſt excuſes his diſciples, and by two parables apologizeth for them; and the drift of both is this, the worke was as yet too high for them; they were <hi>weake,</hi> and that was <hi>weighty.</hi> Its worth noting, Chriſt would not have the Apoſtles goe from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till they had received
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102972:22"/>
                  <hi>power from on high.</hi> He would not leave them while (at leaſt compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) low, to go about a worke which was ſuperlatively high, <hi>i. e. Apoſtolicall.</hi> Never trouble thy ſelfe poore ſoule! about this or that worke, which is too high for thee, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thy power, thy ability, if thou canſt cleare that <hi>ſincerely,</hi> Chriſt will carry himſelfe <hi>ſweetly,</hi> never call thee to it, never put thee on it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Its apparent enough, and one that runs may read ſweetneſſe, and tenderneſſe, in the carriage of Chriſt toward his weake members, in that <hi>be kindly accepts of what they doe in his ſervice, though accompanied with many failings.</hi> What the poore ſoule doth <hi>ſincerely,</hi> that the precious Saviour takes <hi>ſweetly;</hi> and though it be done but <hi>ill,</hi> yet he accepts it <hi>well.</hi> Chriſt remembers himſelfe, if he gave the ſoule but <hi>two talents,</hi> and he looks not for <hi>ten.</hi> And Chriſt conſiders the poore ſoule, that it hath not much; and therefore he is pleaſed with a <hi>little.</hi> The poore creature works but <hi>bunglingly,</hi> and Chriſt accounts the worke <hi>brave;</hi> he accepts the <hi>prayer,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:102972:23"/>though <hi>imperfact;</hi> and yet that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may look upon it as perfect, he <hi>mingles his incenſe with our prayers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 8.3.</note> and ſo <hi>imperfect prayers</hi> from us are put up <hi>perfect</hi> by Chriſt to the Father. The <hi>weake</hi> childe cannot ſpeak <hi>articulately,</hi> and yet the indulgent mother accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, with much love, its poor prattle; ſo doth Chriſt:<note place="margin">

                  </q> No, Chriſt is <hi>kinde,</hi> and albeit thou <hi>carrieſt thy ſelfe,</hi> in thy choiſeſt performances <hi>very weakly;</hi> yet he will <hi>carry himſelfe,</hi> even towards thy failings, <hi>very ſweetly;</hi> and will <hi>accept</hi> of that which thou doſt <hi>kindly,</hi> although done in <hi>much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</hi>

               <p>HAving ſhewed ſome particulars in which Chriſts carriage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſweet and tender towards weak beleevers. I ſhall now give ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why Chriſt carries himſelf thus to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God the Father who did appoint him to be a ſhepherd, did alſo appoint him to be ſweet.</hi> 'Twas the Fathers will that Chriſt ſhould take the care of his flocke, and that he ſhould manage the care with much tenderneſſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the <hi>Lambs.</hi> Looke as Chriſt, though he had a ſingular care of all the flock (and therefore bid <hi>Peter</hi> feed them all) yet he had a ſpeciall care of the <hi>weake</hi> of the flocke, <hi>i. e. Lambs,</hi> and therefore eſpecially he commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to have a care of them; and as ever he would declare his love to himſelſe,<note place="margin">Joh. 21.</note> he ſhould be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over the <hi>Lambs,</hi> and be ſure <hi>to feed them</hi> (which might be another inſtance of the ſpeciall care and tenderneſſe of Chriſt to weak beleevers.) In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102972:24"/>God the Father, when he gave Chriſt his commiſſion, in which he committed the whole flock of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to his care, did put in as it were a ſingular clauſe, that he ſhould be very tender of, and very indulgent towards the weak of the flock. I looke upon the Text not onely as a Propheſie of the carriage of Chriſt, <hi>what it would be,</hi> but alſo as the commiſſion of Chriſt, wherein the Father gives him (as it were) inſtructions what his carriage <hi>ſhould be</hi> towards the <hi>Lambs, i.e.</hi> the <hi>weake ſoules</hi> of the Saints. It may not be paſſed by ſlightly, that the tender carriage of Chriſt towards <hi>bruiſed reeds, and ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flaxes,</hi> is built upon this, that he was <hi>Gods ſervant,</hi> as it were for that purpoſe ſent by God, Eſa. 42.1. <hi>Chriſts ſweetneſſe to weake beleevers, is his ſervice to his Fathers appointment.</hi> God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>appoint Jeſus Chriſt to this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> when he gave him his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he hath anointed me to preach good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to the meeke,</hi>

                  <hi>he hath ſent me to binde up the broken in heart.</hi> The Father charged Chriſt in ſpeciall to carry
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102972:25"/>himſelfe kindly towards them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the great thing (next to the ſweetneſſe of his owne nature, which ſet him on to undertake the office) that moves Chriſt, either to take free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any poore ſoule into his care; or to demeane himſelfe ſweetly in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards it,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.38.</note> is his <hi>Fathers will,</hi> which he came to fulfill, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.38. Now it was the Fathers will that Chriſt ſhould be very tender in his carriage towards the weak.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The very weakneſſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, workes a tenderneſſe in Chriſts bowells, which he cannot but expreſſe in his behaviour.</hi> Weakneſſe, is a word in it ſelfe ſpeaking for tenderneſſe. And a ſweet diſpoſition (ſuch as Chriſts is) needs no other <hi>Oratory</hi> to move pity, but <hi>neceſſity.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt knows how to heare the cry of the ſoules of his.<note place="margin">Exod. 3.7.</note> Affliction hath a cry that can be heard as high as heaven. Thou weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever thy ſecret ſighs come up ſhril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thy Saviour. If thy boſome breath, Chriſts <hi>bowells</hi> heare. And the very <hi>weakneſſe</hi> that is in thee is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough with him (ſuch is his ſweetneſſe) to declare himſelfe very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102972:25"/>pitifull, and <hi>tender</hi> towards thee, in his carriage. The head takes care of the whole body, and every member in particular; but eſpecially of the weake; and that, becauſe ſuch; Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers!<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt is the head of his body,</hi> and <hi>ye are members</hi> (yea ye <hi>weake</hi> little ones) <hi>in particular:</hi> And doubtleſſe the <hi>bead,</hi> becauſe <hi>wiſe,</hi> will have a tender care of the <hi>toes,</hi> becauſe <hi>weake.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>I feare I ſhall breake ſaith the weake ſoule; ſurely if Chriſt be not the kinder to me, I ſhall dye; my ſpirit will faile very ſoone, if his carriage be not very ſweet.</hi>
                  </q> Chriſt knowes thy feare, O thou <hi>feeble ſoule!</hi> and 'tis his feare too. His language ſeems to be ſuch.<note place="margin">Eſa. 57.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſpirit would faile before me, and the ſoules which I have made. Adam</hi> marr'd thee poor ſoule, Chriſt made thee; and ſurely he will not ſuffer his worke to fall, which would, if thy <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſhould <hi>faile.</hi> We let our bigger boyes run by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while we lead our little ones in our hands, and ſhew much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to them; and this we doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our leaſt is the weakeſt. <hi>Chriſt is that, and more then that</hi> (in point of under carriage) <hi>to his children, that we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102972:26"/>are to ours.</hi> Surely if we <hi>who are evill, know how to be tender in our carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our weake children: How much more doth Chriſt (who is the everlaſting, yea and ever-loving Father) know how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe much ſweetneſſe and tenderneſſe in his carriage towards his children,</hi> and that upon this very ground, their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Christ will carry himſelfe thus, that his carriage may be convincing.</hi> Evill men have <hi>hard thoughts</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſometimes they ſpeake as they thinke. Wretches thinke that Chriſt is like them, becauſe they want <hi>bowells,</hi> they conclude that Chriſt wants too. Their <hi>bowells</hi> are <hi>braſſe,</hi> and they will not beleeve that Chriſts are better. Now Chriſts <hi>ſweet carriage</hi> towards weake beleevers, <hi>confutes</hi> all this, and might convince, that his <hi>nature</hi> is as his <hi>name, love</hi>: (weak (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers) Chriſt will make you his <hi>witneſſes.</hi> And that you may teſtifie his carriage to be ſweet to all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he will be ſweet to you who can doe him but little ſervice. Chriſt reſolves to make his <hi>Lambs</hi> beare him <hi>witneſſe</hi> againſt the <hi>Wolves.</hi> His car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102972:26"/>ſhall <hi>beare</hi> him <hi>record,</hi> that he would have <hi>gathered</hi> ſoftly and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>like as a hen gathers her chickens.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 23.27 Mat. 25.44.</note> And becauſe he knows <hi>Goats</hi> will be apt to word it (as at the laſt day) he will appeale to the <hi>experience</hi> of his <hi>Lambs,</hi> to teſtifie for his carriage. He that had but two talents and uſed them as well as he could, ſhall be evidence enough againſt the evill ſervant, that Chriſt is not an <hi>auſtere man.</hi> That Chriſt may <hi>ſtop their mouthes</hi> that are idle, and will not worke, he will fill their mouths that are ſincere, though <hi>weake.</hi> Thy little ciſterne (O weake beleever) ſhall be filled with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe Chriſt will uſe thy ciſterne as an evidence of his ſea. Chriſt will at once evince, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince others wickedneſſe, by the ſweetneſſe of his carriage towards thee, notwithſtanding thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Some <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes of all this.</head>
               <p>I Am loath to let ſo precious a point goe without its application. It may be of ſingular uſe, if Chriſt will be ſo ſweet as to helpe; I hope hee will, and therefore,</p>
               <p>Firſt, this might <hi>informe us in the difference between Chriſts carriage and the creatures.</hi> We have a proverb, <hi>The weakeſt is turned to the wall;</hi> but men practiſe otherwiſe, <hi>caſt them into the kennell,</hi> and trample upon them there. Ah Lord! how unlike are men to Chriſt? He is <hi>very tender</hi> to wards his weake members; they are <hi>very harſh.</hi> Chriſt carries weake Saints in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and men will not let them be in their land. O <hi>England, England,</hi> thy unkinde carriage to Chriſts weake ones, makes me much feare leſt he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee! How dareſt thou be <hi>cruell</hi> to them to whom Chriſt is <hi>kinde.</hi> Verily Chriſt will deſtroy thee if thou ceaſe not from theſe <hi>unkinde</hi> (that I ſay not unmercifull) <hi>carriages</hi> of thine towards his. Thoſe that <hi>he embraceth,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:102972:27"/>thou <hi>perſecuteſt.</hi> Feare leſt he <hi>teare</hi> thee <hi>like a Lion,</hi> for miſ-uſing of his <hi>Lambs.</hi> I have ſometimes wondred, that ever any who pretend to be <hi>ſhepherds</hi> under Chriſt, ſhould preach, or preſſe a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing ☜ with thoſe in the Kingdome, whom Chriſt beares in his boſome.</hi> Surely theſe <hi>ſub-ſhepherds</hi> differ very much from the <hi>ſupreme-ſhepherd,</hi> who is kinde and tender to all; but eſpecially the weake of his flocke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This doctrine, might beget in us lamentation over many, who are indeed Chriſts Lambs, but are apt to utter unkinde and untrue ſpeeches of their ſhepherd.</hi> It makes me ſad to heare a Lamb of Chriſt, ſigh, and ſay, <hi>Surely Chriſt will caſt off me; I am ſo feeble that I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good, and ſo foule, that I doe much which is bad. I am ſo weake that I cannot come to him; and therefore I cannot thinke that he will be ſo kinde to come to me.</hi> Ah poore ſoules! when did you ever finde Chriſt ſo <hi>unkinde</hi> in his carriage, as to make you ſpeake thus? <hi>when was Chriſt a wilderneſſe to thee?</hi> what harſheneſſe haſt thou ever found in him, that thou ſpeakeſt thus hardly of him? Surely I lament to heare
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102972:28"/>thee ſaying, 'tis in vaine to wait on Chriſt. But I bleed to heare thee cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as they <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.1.) <hi>Thou wilt never more come at him:</hi> why poore ſoule? why? is not Chriſt ſweet? is not his carriage tender? doth he not <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his arme?</hi> doth not he <hi>carry in his boſome?</hi> I, he doth ſo by ſome, but he will not ſo by me. Yes by thee (O poore ſoule!) 'tis his cuſtome to be ſweet, in his carriage, to his weake members, ſuch as thou art: verily I lament to heare any ſpeake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of Chriſt, then he is, and they ſhall finde.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſweetneſſe of Chriſts carriage, <hi>reproves the ſowreneſſe of ours, towards his weake members.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet asketh the queſtion (as if it were ſtrange) <hi>who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things?</hi> Zach. 4.10. Though few, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none ſhould, yet many do <hi>deſpiſe;</hi> ſhall I ſay, or <hi>diſcourage,</hi> or both, or worſe, ſuch, as in whom the <hi>day of grace</hi> is but <hi>dawned.</hi> But be reproved ye <hi>rugged ſpirits;</hi> Chriſt beares much with his weak ones, and you bear but <hi>little.</hi> Thou dareſt not deny, but that ſuch are in the faith: but thou wilt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102972:28"/>ſay, they come not up to beleeve all that thou doſt, they are weake: what then, wilt not thou beare with them? ſhall the <hi>elder ſon</hi> beat the <hi>little childe,</hi> his brother, becauſe he is not ſo big as he? ſhall the Dr. in Chriſts Schoole <hi>diſdaine,</hi> and abuſe the <hi>under-graduate,</hi> becauſe not ſo <hi>profound</hi> as himſelfe? ſhould the <hi>ſtrong</hi> beat the <hi>weaks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> as they?<note place="margin">Rom. 15.1. <gap reason="foreign">

Ah Lord! ſhall <hi>children</hi> be whipped, and ſcourged, for not going as faſt as <hi>men?</hi> Did you ever read of ſuch a thing in Chriſts commands? did you ever ſee ſuch an inſtance in Chriſts carriage? Surely we muſt <hi>rejoyce</hi> to hear ſome ſpeaking in <hi>Jacobs voice,</hi> ſweetly for <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> &amp;c. but we muſt <hi>reprove</hi> them, when we feel them with <hi>Eſau's</hi> hands, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling weake ones roughly, for want of <hi>uniformity.</hi> Chriſt reproves (and then 'twill be to purpoſe) thoſe that carry themſelves contrary to that carriage, which they ſee in him, to wards weake beleevers.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102972:29"/>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſts carriage being thus, towards weake beleevers; it muſt needs comfort them to thinke of it. <hi>Ah Lord what a weake creature I am!</hi> why, be of good comfort; thou art weake, and Chriſt is ſweet to ſuch as thee.</p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>The dugs of divine love are full; but I am very feeble:</hi> I <hi>cannot ſucke, though Chriſt open his boſome, and I muſt needs dye, my weakneſſe cannot live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Be of good comfort poore creature! Chriſt will not onely open his <hi>boſome,</hi> but thy <hi>mouth.</hi> He will take thee up in his <hi>armes,</hi> and <hi>carry thee in his boſome;</hi> will not this refreſh thee?</p>
               <p>Ob. Yes: <hi>But I cannot fetch out the milke that lies in his breaſt; I want a ſtrong faith to draw, I am but weake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Be of good comfort <hi>(weake ſoule)</hi> Chriſt is ſweet, and with his fingers he will force out the milke of mercy, into thy mouth (as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth to the weak infant) if thou canſt but open thy mouth, though thou be without breath (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſtrong faith to draw) Chriſt will <hi>fill thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 81.10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Ob. <hi>My feet are ſo feeble, that wheras I ſhould run the way of Chriſts commands;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102972:29"/>I can hardly goe;</hi> I <hi>am fain to creep upon all foure to follow Chriſt, and yet am faint when</hi> I <hi>doe but thus.</hi> Ah Lord! ſaith the poore ſoule, I <hi>ſhall be left behinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Say not ſo. Jeſus Chriſt will tarry, and take thee in his hand; and rather then he will leave thee behinde, he will <hi>carry thee in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi> Remember it, and rejoyce O beleevers. <hi>Chriſt is very ſweet in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, towards his weake members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ere I proceed further in this Uſe, its meet I put in ſome ſignes of thoſe ſoules, to whom I chiefly intend this comfort. <hi>We muſt muzzle the dogs, while we feed the Lambs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This may comfort thee, O poore heart, whoſe griefe it is to thinke how much ſin thou haſt, and how litle grace;</hi> who mourneſt to ſee <hi>ſelfe high,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt low</hi> in thy heart. Me thinks I heare thee cry, <hi>O wretched ſoule that I am! my corruption is ſtrong, it makes me doe the evill which I would not; my grace is but weake, I cannot doe the good which I would. O woe unto me! my heart is hardned to Chriſts wayes? I cannot fetch a turne in them, but my feet are ſwift to evill.</hi> Verily thus 'tis with me; and I am ready to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102972:30"/>dye to thinke that it ſhould be thus: What a <hi>little ſparke of fire is my grace? but what a vaſt ſea of water is my corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; my heart breakes with feare to think leaſt Chriſt will caſt me off, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with me. If I pray, or rather liſpe, tis with much deadneſſe, and little life. If I read, hear, &amp;c. 'tis with little ſincerity and much infirmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What will Chriſt be kinde to me?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes poore Lambe, he will: His carriage was, is, and will be very tender, and ſweet to ſuch weake ones as thou art.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou that canſt doe but little for Chriſt, and weepeſt to thinke or ſee, any doe much against Chriſt. Ah Lord! what a poore worme am I, that cannot kiſſe Chriſt, while others ſpit upon him; others can, and doe crowne him with thornes; but woe is me! I cannot crowne him with gold. Others can, and doe buffet him, but poore</hi> I <hi>cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him. It goes to my heart, to ſee ſome putting a reed into his hand, while I want a Scepter to put there (which is a thouſand times more fitting.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Will ever Chriſt regard me that cannot cry Hoſanna, while others cry cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fige?</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102972:30"/>what will <hi>Chriſt kiſſe me that do not, cannot give him wine, while others give him vinegar. Other wretches thruſt him through with a ſpeare, and I wretch cannot embrace him that while.</hi> I beſeech you Sir, will ever Chriſt <hi>owne me, look upon me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, yes, poore heart, Chriſt loves thee that thus weepeth for him: he takes it well that thou goeſt in mourning, while he is in ſackcloth: though thou cannot <hi>take him downe</hi> from the croſſe, yet he accepts of thy <hi>weeping while thou ſtandeſt by,</hi> and canſt but look on. If thou haſt but a <hi>Lamb-like love</hi> to mourne while thou ſeeſt <hi>thy ſhepherd ſmitten,</hi> Chriſt hath a <hi>ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd-like</hi> ſweetneſſe to pity thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though thou cannot reſcue him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This comfort is for thee, that <hi>albeit thou mourneſt that thy grace is but little, yet thou prizeſt it ſo much as that thou wilt not part with it for a thouſand worlds. Ah Lord! my life ſaith the poor ſoul, is but weake: I am rather dying every day, then alive at any time. My faith is ſo weak, that you may better call it a painted hope, then a powerfull beliefe.</hi> My light <hi>is ſo dim,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102972:31"/>that it is more like the gloworme in the bedge, then a ſtar</hi> (though of the leaſt magnitude) <hi>in the firmament.</hi> Be it as thou ſayeſt, <hi>O weake ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What wilt thou take for thy life?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>Not a million of Rocks of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Wilt thou part with thy faith?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, not for all the riches of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Shall I buy thy light?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>No, if you would give me the light of Moon and Sunne, and the Stars to the bargaine too.</hi> Well, comfort thy ſelfe, O thou poor Lamb. Thy Shepherd is very tender to all, but eſpecially to ſuch as thee. His tenderneſſe will take the advantage of thy weakneſſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound the more. <hi>As thy weakneſſe ſhall abound, ſo ſhall his ſweetneſſe alſo towards thee.</hi> O conſider this text and truth, you weak of the flock; yee who are <hi>weake in your life,</hi> that can hardly ſtir, and <hi>weake in that light,</hi> and can ſcarce ſee; and <hi>weake alſo in your faith,</hi> and can hardly beleeve. Be of good comfort, the Lord Chriſt, who is the <hi>Shepherd of your ſoules,</hi> will have a ſpeciall care
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102972:31"/>of you his <hi>Lambs.</hi> He is ſweet and tender in his carriage to all, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his weake members. <hi>Comfort ye one another with theſe words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, This doctrine ſerves to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to duty.</hi> Work O poor ſouls, though weake. Chriſt will be ſweet in his carriage towards you; <hi>pray, read, beare, &amp;c.</hi> doe all that Chriſt calls for; though thou be <hi>weake,</hi> yet ſtand not out; <hi>Chriſts kindneſſe</hi> will paſſe by thy <hi>weakneſſe.</hi> If thou be <hi>ſincere,</hi> remember he is and will be <hi>ſweet.</hi> Let this grace make thee to abound with, and to overflow in <hi>actings of duties,</hi> as <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of love.</hi> If thou <hi>act</hi> from <hi>love,</hi> Chriſt will <hi>receive in love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, This doctrine calls for <hi>imitation.</hi> Chriſt is tender in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards his weake members; ſo ſhould we. Doe not diſhearten, but incourage weake ſoules. Be ye full of bowells of love, as Chriſt is. His carriage is <hi>ſweet,</hi> let not ours be <hi>ſowre.</hi> Chriſt deales tenderly with weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: O my Brethren, <hi>Be ye follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt as deare children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, but yet in matter of Church, order, and government, they will not doe as I; they doe not hold as others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it out of wilfulneſſe, or weakneſſe, that they doe thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I feare the firſt; ſure I am, 'tis by reaſon of the ſecond, their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. O friends, I beſeech you then, remember, Chriſt beares with weake
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102972:32"/>Lambs; doe ye the like: His carriage was ſweet to all weake beleevers: let ours be ſo too, for they are our weak brethren: You that are ſtrong, ought to beare with them that are weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This doctrine <hi>cryes loudly to ſuch as yet wander from Chriſt, that they would come in.</hi> Friend, Chriſts carriage is, and 'twill be ſweet. <hi>Abſoloms</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was <hi>ſeemingly ſweet,</hi> and 'twas <hi>ſtrongly perſwaſive;</hi> many followed him in the ſimplicity of their hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the appearing ſweetneſſe of his. Beleeve it, that which was but a <hi>ſhew</hi> in <hi>Abſolom,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.</note> is a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He <hi>kiſſes</hi> every ſoule that comes to him. And when he takes the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any heart, he carries himſelfe <hi>uprightly,</hi> and tenderly too. You all love a mild government. You hate tyranny,<note place="margin">Pſal. 75.2. Talis Rex eft Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus. Mollerus in locum.</note> and its your deſire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Scepter managed with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Every one would ſerve a Lord whoſe name is love. O that you could but beleeve this truth. <hi>Chriſt is a moſt gracious Sovereigne. Sweetneſſe is his Scepter. Alphonſus</hi> won much upon the people, by taking a ſheep out of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102972:33"/>the ditch. Jeſus Chriſt takes not one, but all his ſheep out of the ditch. He <hi>gathers</hi> them, though dirty, with his <hi>arme,</hi> and <hi>carries</hi> them in his <hi>boſome.</hi> Will not this, win yet thy heart to ſerve Chriſt? If this will not, then think of the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of Sathan, whoſe ſheep thou art, all the time that thou keepeſt off from Chriſt. When God would diſſwade the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from that kinde of government, which it ſeems, his ſoule liked not, and under which, he was unwilling they ſhould be, ſaith God by his mouth to him. <hi>He will take your ſonnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.11, 12, 13, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>and appoint for himſelfe; for his chariots, and to be his horſemen, and ſome ſhall runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his chariots; and be will take your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be Confectionaries, and to be Cooks, and to be Bakers, &amp;c.</hi> ſo goeth on to ſhew how that in all things he would ſeek himſelf, &amp; not them, ſo that they ſhould <hi>cry out, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeems, God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the miſery of ſuch a condition, that they would be in, if they ſhould come under that government which they fooliſhly (and ſinfully too) deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; would diſſwade them, by telling them of that before, which he knew
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102972:33"/>they would feele afterward. In like manner, let me tell you, if you will ſerve Sathan (and you muſt ſerve him if you will not ſerve Chriſt.) Sathan will be a cruell King to you. He will ride thy ſoule and body too. He will make thee onely to ſerve his luſts (though thou thinke it be thine owne.) Ah poor ſoule! me thinkes I ſee the Devill ſitting upon thy ſhoulders. He laſheth thee cruelly; though thy brawny backe doe not feele it; he will ride thee off thy legs, and he is on the way to hel; and when horſe Thou, and rider Sathan, fall into that pit, thou wilt cry out. But O then 'twill be too late. Therefore be wiſe now. <hi>Kiſſe Chriſt to day,</hi> and he will preſently kiſſe thee. Enter into his ſervice, and thou ſhalt experience his ſweetneſſe. His carriage is very kinde in ſundry particulars, and upon all occaſions as you have heard. <hi>Come, taſte and ſee;</hi> and you ſhall finde Chriſts carriage to be ſweeter to thy ſoule, then thou canſt expreſſe. <hi>He gathers his Lambs with his arme; he carries them in his boſome.</hi> He is the faithfull, yea and the mercifull ſhepherd of his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102972:34"/>flocke. This is his <hi>name,</hi> this his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Becauſe of the ſweetneſſe of this name, <hi>which is as an ointment powred forth, the virgins love him,</hi> doe thou too. Oh that in the ſavour of this <hi>odour,</hi> thy ſoul could run after him. Oh that theſe cords of love might draw thee to Chriſt, and binde thee to him. Verily who ever thou art, if thou come into Chriſt, and embrace him, thou ſhalt finde his carriage to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding tender; and though thou mayeſt ſee much weakneſſe in thy ſelf, yet thou ſhalt experience much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt; for 'tis his <hi>office,</hi> his <hi>charge,</hi> his <hi>care,</hi> his <hi>carriage,</hi> to be <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> towards all his, eſpecially thoſe of his that are <hi>weake.</hi>

                  <hi>carriage of Chriſt as ſweet</hi> to thoſe that are <hi>accidentally weake,</hi> by what the Prophet ſpeakes here of his carriage to <hi>thoſe that are with young.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now as a foundation I ſhall lay this poſition, which is clearly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from theſe words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The carriage of Chriſt is very ſweet, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his members, who are accidentally weake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I call ſome members <hi>accidentally weake,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch as are ſo <hi>habitually.</hi> And I uſe this phraſe of <hi>accidentally weake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what it is.</note> becauſe I would by it note thoſe, in whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>habits of grace are ſtrong,</hi> and ſo they are not liable (as the others were) to a conſtant <hi>weakneſſe;</hi> onely at ſome times upon ſome occaſion <hi>(as it were by accident)</hi> they become <hi>weak</hi> and feeble.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102972:35"/>ſome great ſorrow or ſickneſſe under which they lye; or elſe by ſome great and deſperate fall which they have had. In like manner, beleevers who are growne up to <hi>Men</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo freed from that <hi>habituall weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> which is in <hi>babes,</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſometimes come to be <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally weake,</hi> by reaſon, either of <hi>great ſervices,</hi> to which Chriſt calls them, or <hi>ſharpe ſufferings,</hi> unto which Chriſt doth bring them; or elſe by <hi>ſome falls into ſin,</hi> which through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity (and as it were by accident) they have taken. Now of Chriſts <hi>ſweet carriage</hi> unto ſuch, I ſuppoſe the Prophet doth ſpeake here under the metaphor of a ſhepherds <hi>ſweet carriage,</hi> towards thoſe <hi>that are with young.</hi> Even the <hi>ſtrong of the flocke</hi> (ſuch as the <hi>Ewes</hi>) may be, and ſometimes are <hi>weake</hi> (eſpecially when with <hi>young</hi>) or (as the word will alſo beare) when <hi>they give ſucke.</hi> For <hi>bearing,</hi> and <hi>giving of ſucke,</hi> doe (as it were <hi>accidentally</hi>) much <hi>weaken.</hi> And thus Chriſts carriage is ſweet to his who are not onely weak <hi>habitually,</hi> as <hi>Lambs;</hi> but alſo who are <hi>accidentally</hi> weake, as <hi>Ewes</hi> that <hi>give

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102972:36"/>his members; ſo as that you may ranke them with thoſe, who are in the <hi>higheſt forme</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Schoole,</hi> not onely above <hi>little children,</hi> but even above the <hi>young men, with the Fathers:</hi> And of whom you may conceive the Apoſtle ſpeakes, when he ſaith, <hi>wee that are ſtrong:</hi> But yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon of ſome occurrences in their Chriſtian courſe; and ſome paſſages which <hi>providence</hi> doth <hi>(as it were by accident)</hi> now, and then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to befall them, they are much debilitated and <hi>weakned</hi> thereby; ſo as that they doe in that reſpect, at ſome times lye and groan under ſome <hi>weakneſſe.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Of the <hi>ſweet carriage</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt to each of theſe, I ſhall ſpeake parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and by themſelves: And ſo much the rather I ſhall ſpeak of theſe, becauſe I conceive that the phraſe

                  <hi>ſuxit,</hi> which fignifies to give ſucke; ſo that the phraſe being thus. <hi>Thoſe that are with young.</hi> I thinke it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to thoſe three ſorts mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>It may allude to thoſe that are weake by worke.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſets out his worke for the Lord Jeſus towards the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians, as if he were big with them, as an Ewe is big with young: <hi>My little children of whom I travell in birth,</hi> Galat. 4.19. <hi>Paul</hi> in the worke of his Miniſtery, was as it were big with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102972:38"/>young. In like manner any beleever called out to, or ſet about more then ordinary worke, may be ſaid to be big with young. And ſo much the rather, becauſe the worke of child-bearing, or of being big with young; and to bring forth, is a worke which doth <hi>weaken</hi> more then ordinary; to this the generallity of Expoſitors ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this place.</p>
               <p>2. It may allude alſo unto ſuch as are <hi>weake by reaſon of falls into ſin.</hi> So thou ſhalt finde the phraſe of <hi>being with childe,</hi> or <hi>young,</hi> often in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner applied to ſuch as are big with ſinne. <hi>Vox ſignifical</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ilyricus</hi> upon the word) <hi>tum poenam, tun culpam.</hi> And ſo 'tis uſed both in a ſenſe of ſinning, and of ſufferings: ſometimes ſinne and temptation <hi>(through the incogitancy of the beſt belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers)</hi> may commit as it were a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>rape</hi> upon the ſoule; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeyer may be (as it were) <hi>big with young,</hi> in a ſinfull ſenſe. For when temptation cornes, and in a manner forceth the ſoule, there is <hi>ſomething within us</hi> (which was not in Chriſt) and that may concur, and conduce to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102972:38"/>a <hi>ſinfull conception;</hi> and the ſoule may be <hi>big</hi> (as it were) <hi>with ſinne.</hi> The Apoſtle hath a phraſe which is to this purpoſe, <hi>When luſt hath conceived it bringeth forth, Jam.</hi> 1.15. It is an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a naturall conception and birth. So that we ſhall not, I ſuppoſe over-much ſtraine the place of the Prophet here, by applying this phraſe to this thing alſo. Sad experience tells us: that <hi>the chaſteſt ſoules of the Saints, are ſometimes in this reſpect, guilty of ſpirituall adultery.</hi> Beleevers are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times big of illegitimate births and conceptions. <hi>Luſt</hi> ſometimes may <hi>conceive,</hi> and they may be <hi>big with young,</hi> in that reſpect alſo.</p>
               <p>3. It may allude unto thoſe that are <hi>weake by reaſon of ſorrow and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi> And thus the Holy Ghoſt doth often uſe the Metaphor of being <hi>big with young.</hi> As <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26.18. <hi>We have been with childe, and been in paine.</hi> And thus the great ſorrow and trouble, unto which God threatens to bring his people, is ſet out by their <hi>being as it were big with young, and holding their hands upon their ſides,</hi> Jer. 30.6.</p>

               <p>Saints are ſometimes <hi>big with young,</hi> in regard of good workes, unto which the Spirit doth ſtir them. And towards theſe Chriſt carries himſelfe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102972:39"/>ſweetly. For (as the Prophet here ſpeaks) <hi>he leads them gently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The expreſſion notes two things, as proving the Propoſition.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is ſo ſweet to thoſe that are weak</hi> (while in or about ſome holy worke) <hi>that he is with them, and leads them.</hi> As he ſaid to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; <hi>Behold I am with you to the end of the world</hi> (that was, in regard of ſtrength and aſſiſtance) ſo he doth to all his working members. Hee doth aſſiſt them. He is with them. And he leads them. Beleevers are ſent about ſome worke of Chriſt ſometimes as it were a long way; and Chriſt (that he may ſhew himſelfe ſweet) goes with them and <hi>leads them.</hi> The Ewe big with young, is unweldy, and it is paine unto it to goe. Now the ſhepherd that is ſweet leads it. And the belce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver big with young (<hi>i.e.</hi> bent, reſolved upon ſome good buſineſſe for Chriſt) is weake, and in paine it is, while in travell, till it be delivered: Now Jeſus Chriſt to ſhew his ſweetneſſe to ſuch a ſoule, takes it by the arme (as it were) and leads it.</p>
               <p>2. That Chriſts carriage may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102972:40"/>to be ſweet, <hi>he is not onely preſent to lead; but tenderly preſent, to lead [gently.]</hi> He leads ſoftly, that he may lead ſweetly. I know there is but one word in the originall, but it includes both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the act, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the act. The word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>i.e.</hi> ſo as may ſuit beſt with their quietneſſe and eaſe. Jeſus Chriſt doth not drive furiouſly, but tenderly. He doth not (as the ſame Rabbin notes) over-drive his flocke; but gently, ſoftly, and ſweetly, he leads all his weake-working members. He will lead you, O ye working beleevers! according to your weakneſſe, ſtep by ſtep,<note place="margin">Pedeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.</note> as <hi>Vatablus</hi> gloſſeth the place. Chriſt will not firſt lay a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon your backe, and then come after laſhing, to make you runne, when it may be you can hardly goe. But he will come and lead you, and walke with you, your owne pace:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102972:40"/>As he will aſſiſt, ſo he will aſſiſt ſweetly. <hi>He will lead [gently.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus as <hi>Jacob</hi> (the moſt faithfull and mercifull man that ever was a ſhepherd) ſaid of his flocks and herds with young; he would not over-drive them, but (ſaid he) <hi>I will lead on ſoftly according as the cattell that goeth before me, can be able to endure;</hi> or (as it is in the Hebrew) according to the eaſe of their feet, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.14. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Jeſus Chriſt he will ſoftly lead (for the word is the ſame in both places) his Ewes big with young; he will gently lead thoſe that labour in any worke of his. Thus ſweet is his carriage towards thoſe that are weake, by reaſon of any great worke, about which he ſets them at any time, and with which they are big by the Holy Ghoſts over-ſhadowing of them. Working beleevers, minde it. Your work (you ſay) is hard, it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers your ſtrength, and it makes you weake: remember Chriſts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhall be ſweet: He will be with you in your worke: And that it may appeare he is tender, and mindfull of your weakneſſe, he will lead you, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102972:41"/>that very <hi>gently;</hi> ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>He ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi>

               <p>THat you may yet more clearly ſee the ſweetneſſe of Chriſts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, towards all ſuch members of his, as are weake in regard of worke; I ſhall declare it in ſix particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Chriſts carriage appears to be ſweet and tender towards his weake-working members, <hi>in that he puts them about no other worke then ſuch as himſelfe both done.</hi> Maſters and Sovereignes carry themſelves ſweetly to ſervants,<note place="margin">Nihil lege ulla ſanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret in alios cu jus non ipſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in ſe daret do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Dan. Par. in Hiſt. Univerſ. medull. p. 40.</note> and ſubjects, when they imploy them in no worſer workes then themſelves would doe. Its reported of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (the great Law-maker) that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed nothing by Law upon others, of which he did not firſt ſhew a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in his owne practiſe. 'Tis true of Jeſus Chriſt, you read of no work which he requires of his, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102972:41"/>did not while in the fleſh. Doth he require beleevers to reſiſt Sathan, fight with the Devill? <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. He did the ſame himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. Doth Chriſt call upon beleevers to <hi>pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. and <hi>ſtrive in prayer? Rom.</hi> 15.30. He did as much himſelfe while on earth. He prayed often, he prayed long, all night, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.12. and fervently, <hi>with ſtrong cryes,</hi> and <hi>teares, Heb.</hi> 5.7. Are beleevers called to <hi>faſt?</hi> (an extraordinary worke, and ſuch as is not for every day, no nor for every Chriſtian, as Divines gather from <hi>Luke</hi> 5.36, 37.) why conſider Jeſus Chriſt in this worke went before them. <hi>He faſted,</hi> and that longer then he requires us, even <hi>forty dayes,</hi> as tis <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. Muſt Miniſters <hi>preach, diſpute, conteſt</hi> for the truths of the Goſpel? they are to doe no more then what Chriſt hath done before them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, did Chriſt ever call you to any ſervice about which he would not go himſelfe, if need were? Servants you have good Maſters, who put you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout no worſe worke then they would doe themſelves. And belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers you have a ſweet Saviour, who
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102972:42"/>did doe that himſelfe about which he ſets you, and never will lay that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon your backes, which he would not if need were, beare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Oh how tender and ſweet is Chriſt to all his working members, in not ſetting them about any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice but what he is willing to doe himſelfe. Oh beleevers, you may comfort your ſelves in any ſervice to which Chriſt calls you, with this thought, what though the buſineſſe be burdenſome? what though the worke be weakning? yet ſtill Chriſt is ſweet, kinde, tender, in that he hath ſet you about no other, then what himſelfe hath done.</p>
               <p>2. Its eaſie to ſee ſweetneſſe in the crrriage of Chriſt towards his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members, in that <hi>he hath provided, and accordingly gives incouragement unto them, anſwerable to all the diſcouragement they doe, or can meet withall. Ezekiel</hi> was to go out upon ſome deſign for Chriſt; and ſuch was his weakneſſe that he falls at the appearance of Chriſts coming to command him: But mark what Chriſt ſaith to him, <hi>Son of man ſtand upon thy feet, Ezek.</hi> 2.1. Chriſt loves
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102972:42"/>(ſaith a late Commentator upon this) to incourage man to his duty. Its the weakneſſe of beleevers, when ſet about any worke, they are apt to diſpond and be diſcouraged: But its the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, he is ready to raiſe up your ſpirits, and to take off their diſcouragements.</p>
               <p>Three things uſually diſcourage beleevers when they are to ſet about any buſineſſe for Chriſt; and Chriſt is ſo ſweet as that he hath provided, and doth give out incouragements an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to them all.
1. <hi>Internall reluctancy in your owne ſpirits.</hi> I would,<note place="margin">Saints are unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing.</note> and I could doe this or that (ſaith the beleever) but I finde ſuch reluctancy within, my heart is ſo backward, my ſpirit ſo unwilling, that it diſcourageth me much; why Chriſt hath ſaid he will make thee willing. <hi>His people ſhall be a willing people, Pſal</hi> 110.3. Chriſt hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a <hi>voyce behinde</hi> to put thee on to that, whereunto thou art backward. <hi>Thine eares ſhall heare a ward behinde thee</hi> (becauſe of the reluctancy that is in thee) <hi>ſaying this is the way walke in it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 30.21</note> I will put my <hi>Spirit</hi> within you (which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102972:43"/>is a <hi>free Spirit</hi>) and becauſe you are backward, and unwilling, he ſhall make you <hi>forward</hi> and willing, <hi>and cauſe you</hi> (ſweetly) <hi>to walke in my wayes, Ezek.</hi> 36.28. Chriſt hath provided an incouragement anſwerable to this diſcouragement of thine (Oh Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.) Thy ſpirit is unwilling, and doth reſiſt, his Spirit ſhall rake that away.2. <hi>Diſgrace, and oppoſition from man,</hi> is a great diſcouragement to working beleevers: and Chriſt hath provided incouragement ſuited thereunto. Men will deride me, and oppoſe me if I do this or that: The diſgrace of the proud, and the oppoſition of the violent, do mightily weaken my hands in worke, ſaith the beleever ſometimes. But know, O ſoul! Chriſt hath provided incouragement anſwerable to this. Thou ſayeſt men oppoſe thee, Chriſt ſaith he is with thee; <hi>Feare not, I am with thee</hi> (ſaid the Viſion to <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Act.</hi> 18.10. Men thou ſayeſt diſgrace thee, O weake-working ſoule! The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (ſaith Chriſt) will honour thee. <hi>If any man ſerve me, him will my Father honour, Joh.</hi> 12.26. ſtrengthen thy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102972:43"/>weake hands (O working ſoule!) with theſe words: Here is ſuitable incouragement unto thy diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this particular alſo. </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Doubt of ſucceſſe</hi> diſcourageth ſometimes thoſe who are upon worke for Chriſt. The hands of the beleever begin to fall downe in the midſt of his worke when he doubts of ſucceſſe. I ſhall labour in vaine (ſaith the ſoul) this diſcourageth me. <hi>Your labour ſhall not be in vaine</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) let that incourage thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to goe to <hi>Pharoah</hi> about a gallant worke (<hi>Iſraels</hi> freedome) He doubts the ſucceſſe, <hi>But behold they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.1. That diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him; Chriſt therefore takes off that diſcouragement. <hi>If they will not beleeve at the voice of the firſt ſigne, they will or ſhall beleeve the voice of the latter,</hi> ſaith the Lord. I would fight and reſiſt Sathan: Shall I be ſuccesfull? Yes, O beleever! Chriſt hath ſaid ſo. <hi>He, i.e. Sathan ſhall flye,</hi> Jam. 4.7. <hi>and the God of peace ſhall tread down Sathan under your feet,</hi> Rom. 20. Thus, anſwerable to all thoſe diſcouragements which beleevers are liable to meet with,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102972:44"/>Chriſt hath provided incouragements; and this clearly argues Chriſt to be ſweet in his carriage towards his working members. But,</p>
               <p>3. In as much as <hi>Chriſt gives abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſtrength to performe whatſoever he calls any beleever to;</hi> it is cleare, that his carriage is ſweet to thoſe which worke; Chriſt gives power to doe what ever he ſets beleevers about; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt ſtand on his feet; alas! he is weake, and cannot. Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit therefore enters into him that hee may. <hi>Stand upon thy feet, Son of man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and the Spirit entred into him, and he stood up,</hi> Ezek. 2.1. I thanke our Lord Chriſt who hath <hi>inabled me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.12. the Apoſtles muſt preach to all Nations, and Chriſt gives them tongues to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them ſo to doe. Ah! ſaith the poore ſoule, the worke is weighty, and I am weake. True <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Chriſt will make thee ſtrong and able, O weake ſoule. If the burthen be big, thy back ſhall be ſtrengthened. Chriſt will not lay a heavy burthen upon weake ſhoulders. Doubtleſſe he will ſtrengthen thy ſhoulders, O beleeving
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102972:44"/>ſoule, according to the weight of that he layes on. I muſt anſwer before Kings, and Councellors, and States for Chriſt (ſaith the beleever.) But alas! the worke is weighty, and I weake. Feare not O beleever! Chriſt will be with thee, and will give thee a <hi>mouth,</hi> and <hi>wiſdome, which all thy adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſhall not be able to gainſay, nor reſiſt, Luke</hi> 21.15. I am to goe a long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Chriſt, but I have but weake legs (ſaith the ſoul) why Chriſt will ſtrengthen thy legs, O ſoule! ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length of thy jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I am to lift a great weight (ſaith the ſoule) and have but weake hands. Chriſt will ſtrengthen thy hands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the weight which thou art to lift, O poore ſoule! what ever the worke be, about which Chriſt ſets any ſoule; if the ſoule carry it ſelf ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in doing, Chriſt will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſweetly in helping. Howſoever <hi>hard-hearted Pharaoh</hi> may command the number of brickes, and not give ſtraw to helpe: yet <hi>tender-hearted Chriſt</hi> will not. If he command the ſoul to work, he will ſend the Spirit to helpe with ſtrength ſuitable to that worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:102972:45"/>4. Chriſts carriage appeares to be ſweet to working Beleevers, in that <hi>he will perfect their worke by his owne ſtrength, wherein it was deficient by their weakneſſe. Thou workeſt all our workes for us, and in us,</hi> Eſa. 26.12. The beleever workes, and leaves that which hee doth, very imperfect, becauſe of his weakneſſe: But Chriſt comes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that imperfection, becauſe of his ſweetneſſe. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>thou wilt perfect that which concerneth me,</hi> Pſal. 138.8. The beleever is ſet on the worke of <hi>prayer,</hi> and Chriſt ſends the <hi>Spirit</hi> to helpe his <hi>infirmities:</hi> And at the end of prayer, he takes it, and <hi>mingles with it his own incenſe,</hi> and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it perfect to the Father. His pure water perfects the ſoules puddle. Looke as the writing-Schoole-Maſter, not onely holds the hand of the learner, in every letter, but after al, takes the pen and perfects the whole: So Jeſus Chriſt holds the hand all the while the beleever is writing (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a love-letter to Heaven) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſhaking of the beleevers weake hand, there are after all, many imperfections, he takes the golden
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102972:45"/>pen of his owne grace, and perfects every letter, that it comes to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand perfect. O the darke, and deformed lines, that beleevers draw, when ſet about ſome curious peece. How imperfectly doe they performe that, about which they are ſet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. But oh the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt! who comes with his owne pencill, and after all, perfects thoſe imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Beleevers carry themſelves weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all their workes, and almoſt mar all, about which they are ſet; but Chriſt carries himſelfe ſweetly, and comes and mends all that they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, making their botched and bungled workes very brave with his owne hand. Surely, beleeving ſoules, you have found this. How many times did Chriſt ſet off that duty richly, which came from thee poorly? How oft hath he perfected thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect performances? when thy weakneſſe came ſhort, hath not his ſweetneſſe made it up? Beleeve it friends, Chriſt carries himſelf ſweetly toward working beleevers.</p>
               <p>5. The carriage of Chriſt appears to be ſweet towards, &amp;c. <hi>in that he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102972:46"/>comes in often to the ſoules of his working members with refreſhing in the midst of their labours.</hi> Beleevers are weake, and (while at worke) are apt to be weary and to faine: But Chriſt ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſweet, in that he viſits them, and refreſhes them in their worke. 'Twas the praiſe of <hi>Boaz,</hi> and 'twas a ſweet carriage of his, when he went into the field, where his ſervants reaped, to incourage them in their work. And its the praiſe of Chriſts ſweet carriage toward working beleeevers, that he viſits them frequently, and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them ſweetly while they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his worke. <hi>Baruch</hi> was at worke for Chriſt, when he had written the words of Chriſt at the mouth of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah;</hi> but he began to flag and ſaint: And Chriſt gave a particular Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to the Prophet, to comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh <hi>Baruch. Jer.</hi> 46. <hi>Chriſt gives power to the faint, to them</hi> (who by working have as it were) <hi>no might,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 40.29.</note> he refreſheth, and <hi>gives ſtrength. Daniel</hi> was at a great worke, and his ſtrength was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gone while he <hi>faſted,</hi> and there came <hi>like the appearance of a man</hi> (that was not Chriſt, but an Angel from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102972:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt) and he <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> him. Oh the ſweet refreſhings which Chriſt, by his Spirit, brings into the ſoules of weak Saints, even when they are ready to ſaint and ſinke in their work. How oft (O beleeving ſoul!) hath Chriſt refreſhed thee, by his ſweet ſpirituall ſmilings on thee, even in the time of duty, and while thou wert about his worke? Surely, thou muſt needs ſay, Chriſt carries himſelf ſweetly toward working beleevers; doth not thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in this particular, ſeale to this truth?</p>
               <p>6. It is evident, that the carriage of Chriſt is ſweet to the working Saints, <hi>in that at the end of their worke be gives them reſt and reward.</hi> Its ſweetneſſe in Chriſt, that he ſhould accept any worke of the beleevers, but more, that he ſhould reward. Chriſt will deale ſweetly with his working ſervants, he hath made <hi>beds</hi> of <hi>reſt</hi> for them in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Sathan deals not ſo;<note place="margin">They ſhall reſt in their beds. Eſa. 57.2.</note> his ſervants never reſt to eternity. I am weary (ſaith the working beleever) Thou ſhalt <hi>reſt</hi> anon, oh weak ſoul! <hi>There remains a reſt to the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4.9. The word is a keeping of a Sabbath.<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:102972:47"/>There is a ſweet and a long <hi>Sabbath</hi> remaines for you, O working Saints! and the morning thereof is ready to dawne; or about morn, and 'twill be day.

                  <hi>Working Paul</hi> ſhall have that reſt; yea, and <hi>weake thou</hi> too, when the day ſhall dawne.

And if reſt be not enough to declare Chriſt to be ſweet to his working members; they ſhall haue reward alſo. You ſhall not loſe your labour, yee working Saints: Chriſt comes, and his <hi>reward</hi> is with him; <hi>Apoc.</hi> 22.12. you ſhall not worke all day and all night too, Beleevers. You ſhall reſt at <hi>right,</hi> and have reward in the <hi>morning.</hi> The upright ſhall have <hi>dominion in the morning,</hi> Pſal. 49.14. For a dayes work, you ſhall have eternities reſt. For a little labour in this world, you ſhall have an everlaſting reward<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102972:47"/>in the other world. Oh ſweet Chriſt! that giveſt long reſt for a little labour, and great reward for little worke. Surely, when you ſhall in the end of your dayes-work go into <hi>Immanuels</hi> land, and there reſt your ſoules upon the roſie bankes that are by the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall ſtreames which runne there, you will cry out oh! How ſweet is Chriſt towards his working members, that gives ſuch raviſhing reſt to them after all their works for him; when the day ſhall be in which Chriſt ſhall come with Crownes of glory, to put upon the heads of working Saints, and you ſhall feel the weight of that glory, with which you ſhall then be crowned; then you will ſay, oh! the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt towards work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beleevers, who gives ſuch an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall weight of glory,</hi> for ſuch <hi>light</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi> works as the beſt Saints do. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude (O thou beleeving <hi>Ewe,</hi> who art big with young) that the day comes in which thou ſhalt travell, and bring forth; and then thou ſhalt ſee that Chriſt deals ſweetly with ſuch as thou art, when for the joy of that reſt, and reward which thou ſhalt

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Some reaſons of the point.</head>
               <p>YOu have ſeen both <hi>[that]</hi> and <hi>[how]</hi> Chriſt carries himſelfe ſweet to working beleevers. I will now adde a word why Chriſt doth thus. And there may be (to omit others) three reaſons given of this.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Chriſt loves to make his carriage anſwerable to himſelfe.</hi> He is ſweet in himſelfe, and therefore will ſhew it by being ſo to his. As he will declare ſweetneſſe to thoſe who are weak and cannot worke at all; ſo will he ſhew ſweetneſſe to thoſe who worke, and are weake therein, or thereby. As
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102972:48"/>Chriſt ſees our condition, he is moved with compaſſion. He hath <hi>yerning bowells</hi> towards working beleevers, and he cannot refraine, (ſuch is his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) but he muſt ſhew it. Men love to ſhew themſelves (as we ſay) what they are. Chriſt doth ſurely love to carry himſelfe ſweetly, that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may ſay, <hi>As we have beard, ſo have we ſeen in the Saviour of our God.</hi> Others, by their words told us, that Chriſt was ſweet, and in our workes we finde it ſo. When Chriſt ſpake to the man ſicke of the palſie, <hi>Thy ſinnes be forgiven thee:</hi> He did it, that men might know the power of his God-head (ſaith he giving the reaſon of that ſpeech) <hi>that ye may know the ſon of man hath power on earth to forgive ſins,</hi> Mat 9.6. As Chriſt ſpeakes in ſuch a manner, as that he may be knowne to be what he is; ſo he acts alſo, he <hi>leads</hi> his working mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>gently,</hi> and carries himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them ſweetly, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelfe to be as he is.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Chriſt ſees that thoſe that worke for him, cannot worke without him:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that he carries himſelfe ſo ſweetly to them. The ſtrongeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aint
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102972:49"/>is too weake for any worke if left by Chriſt. Indeed Chriſt cannot have his worke done by any ſoule, in caſe he deale not ſweetly with it. The <hi>big Ewe</hi> cannot goe if not <hi>let gently;</hi> and the working beleever cannot act, if not dealt withall ſweetly. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> Joh. 15.5. This Chriſt ſees, and therefore it is that he is thus ſweet.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. Phil. 4.13.</note> Becauſe Chriſt knowes our weakneſſe, as that without him we can doe nothing, therefore he ſhewes his ſweetneſſe, that by him we may be <hi>able to doe all things</hi> by his ſtrength.</p>
               <p>3. Chriſt is thus ſweet in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to wards his working members, <hi>that he may leave all without excuſe.</hi> Chriſts carriage to his ſhall condemne wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at the laſt day, that will be none of his. Sinners will be ready to ſay, we did not ſerve thee becauſe there was harſhneſſe in thee: Thy worke was hard, and thou wert auſtere: Thy ſervants went for the moſt part in ſackcloth, while others wore filke, &amp;c. Now Chriſt will ſtop their mouthes by his ſweet carriage. Wretches that will not worke for Chriſt, ſhall be left without all excuſe, when they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102972:49"/>ſhall be told, and convinced of the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, to his working members. Chriſt is reſolved to ſtop all mouthes in that day. His ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to <hi>labourers, ſhall ſilence loyterers.</hi> His <hi>gentle leading of workers, ſhall condemn the idle-living of wanderers.</hi> The <hi>Ewes</hi> that have been <hi>big with young,</hi> ſhall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt thoſe, that would not have Chriſt to be their Shepherd; Chriſts ſweet carriage to the one, ſhall convince and condemne the obſtinate ſtanding out of the other. Wretches, Chriſt cals upon you to work for him; he hath given you talents, and he bids you imploy them; you are fearfull and ſluggiſh, you <hi>hide your talents,</hi> and ſpare your pains; you do not, will not act, or work for Chriſt. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you ſhall be without excuſe, at the great day: It will be fooliſh and falſe to plead, Chriſt was a hard maſter. His working members by their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhall confute you, and Chriſts ſweet carriage to them ſhall leave you without apology, or excuſe.</p>

               <p>HAving ſeen the ſweetneſſe of Chriſts carriage towards all his Ewes, and ſuch as are big with young, <hi>i.e.</hi> thoſe who work for him. I ſhall offer ſome thing by way of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſome uſes. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It ſerves to diſcover the difference between Chriſts ſervice, and all other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and between his carriage of himſelfe towards thoſe that worke for him, and the carriage of all others towards any that worke for them.</hi> If men ſerve the world, they do not finde (alway at leaſt) ſweet carriage. Its often ſeen among men, after their worke is over, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is oft forgotten. It ſtands upon record, as one of the greateſt ſtains of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, that after <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> had ſincerely and ſucceſſefully ſerved that Commonwealth (when it was almoſt ſpent and ready to dye) and had thereby raiſed it up: he was baniſhed, or forced to inhabit in a poor waſte deſert. Inſomuch that when he dyed he commanded this to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102972:50"/>be ingraven over his ſepulchre, <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta patria, ne oſſa quidem mea habes.</hi> The Commonwealth was ſo baſe, as not to have his bones, who ſaved their blood: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, of a poor man, who had been very ſerviceable to a diſtracted State, when it was warred againſt by a great Prince. The <hi>poore man</hi> delivered the City by his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> but no man did ſo much as <hi>remember that ſame poor man,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.15. And it is reported of Cardinall <hi>Woolſey,</hi> that upon his death-bed he ſhould ſay in much ſadneſſe of ſpirit, <hi>If I had ſo faithfully ſerved Jeſus Chriſt as I have done my Maſter</hi> (<hi>Hen.</hi> the 8.) <hi>he would not have caſt me off, as my Maſter the King hath.</hi> Oh! that men could but ſee the difference that is between the ſervice of man, and the ſervice of Chriſt: How ever the <hi>ſons of men</hi> will deale (like themſelves) with their ſervants <hi>ſordidly;</hi> the <hi>ſon of God</hi> will deal with his <hi>ſweetly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Doctrine may alſo <hi>reproove theſe, who deale not with Chriſts working members as Chriſt doth.</hi> Oh how cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly and courſely do many deal with Chriſts workmen! How doe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102972:51"/>ride, diſgrace, oppoſe, and perſecute the <hi>Ewes</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> thoſe that are big and travell in work for him. How did a company of vile perſons vilifie <hi>Paul,</hi> who yet was as an <hi>Ewe,</hi> ready to bring forth, who was in travell with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> as with Chriſts <hi>Lambs.</hi> And <hi>then thoſe that were borne after the fleſh did perſecute him, that was both borne, and [bearing] after the Spirit, even ſo it is now.</hi> But nevertheleſſe, <hi>what ſaith the Scripture?</hi> what ſaith the point? <hi>Chriſt deales ſweetly with his working members.</hi> Are not they then to be reproved that deal harſhly? Be reproved therefore all of you (eſpecially you that pretend to the worke of Chriſt) for not dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling kindly with his working ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; ſeeſt thou a perſon, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher that doth the worke of the Lord, that preacheth Chriſt, worketh for Chriſt, be reproved for thy unkinde, unchriſtian dealing with him, as knowing that in that thou art very unlike to Jeſus Chriſt. Be reproved therefore, O ye rugged ſpirits, who deale ruggedly with any of Chriſts working members; what though they differ from thy way, if they doe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102972:51"/>Chriſts worke, Chriſt deals ſweetly with them, and ſo ſhould you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The truth of this Doctrine falls heavy upon thoſe, <hi>who being both inabled for, and called to the worke of Chriſt in any kinde, and yet refuſe it.</hi> Friend; how is it that Chriſt hath given thee a talent and thou wilt not occupy it for his uſe? How is it that Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee parts, and ſet thee in place, and afforded thee opportunities to ſerve him, and yet thou wilt not worke? Dareſt thou ſay, either that he is a hard Maſter, or that his work is unreaſonable, or his carriage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Be convinced ye loyterers that will not labour for Jeſus Chriſt: At the day of account you will want an excuſe, when all the working mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come and ſay, <hi>The worke that we did for Chriſt, was honourable; the incouragement which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt was unſpeakable, and his carriage to us all along, was paſſing ſweet and amiable;</hi> then will you be dumb and ſpeechleſſe, as not having any thing to ſay for your ſelves why you ſtood out from his worke and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102972:52"/>
               <p n="4">4. The Doctrine ſpeakes <hi>incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all thoſe who labour for the Lord, who are at worke for Chriſt.</hi> You that are in Chriſts <hi>Vineyard;</hi> that labour (though in the heat of the day) who ſweat in the ſervice for your Saviour: conſider, his carriage is, and will be ſweet towards you. <hi>Goe on, hold on, give not out:</hi> you are in his ſervice who is very ſweet: what ever the carriage of the ſtanders by be, his will be like himſelfe, <hi>i.e.</hi> loving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But yet (will you ſay) we find harſh uſage in the world, meerly for being in this worke. We thinke wee ſhould be dealt better withall by men if we did do ſo much for Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surely, if we were onely <hi>Lambes</hi> our ſelves, we ſhould finde kinder carriage: But this renders us hatefull, and makes men harſh that we are <hi>Ewes big with young, i.e.</hi> that we are indeavouring to bring forth ſomewhat for Chriſt, that we would have others <hi>Lambes</hi> as well as our ſelves, and that we can never be well, but when at work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Well be it ſo, yet be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged: It is your glory to be Chriſts <hi>Ews.</hi> Chriſt hath dealt wel with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102972:52"/>you, in making you able to work for him, and he will carry himſelfe kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you, while you worke for him. What though the travellers by the way, curſe and revile the labourers in the field, ſo long as the Lord of the harveſt (<hi>Boaz</hi> like) bleſſe you, and ſpeake kindly to them, <hi>the Lord be with you.</hi> Verily (ye working Saints) who are labouring for the Lord Chriſt, you have no juſt ground of diſcouragement from all the unkinde uſage of the creature, ſo long as you have the kinde carriage of Chriſt: Oh! <hi>be not diſcouraged ſo as to give out, but be rather incouraged ſo as to goe on in the work of the Lord,</hi> for as much as you know your labour ſhall not be in vaine, and that Chriſts carriage to you-ward, ſhall be ſweet.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, the Doctrine ſpeakes <hi>comfort to all the working members of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> You <hi>Ewes that are big with young,</hi> here is a point <hi>big with comfort.</hi> You goe on heavily; you groan while in travell; you cry out (as the Prophet in another caſe) <hi>My belly, my belly!</hi> well he of good comfort, Chriſt is with you, and will be ſweet in his carriage
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102972:53"/>to you, while you worke Chriſt can? not be away; Chriſt is not abſent and idle, while you are travelling in his worke; no, he is preſent, and will be helpfull; he will be with you, and lead you gently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is thy worke (O bleſſed <hi>Ewe?</hi>) what art ready to bring forth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> (will ſome ſay) my worke is wofull. I am working too, not to bring forth any great good, but to caſt forth great evill. Chriſt hath ſet me on worke to cleanſe a kennell, to carry out a dunghill: I meane to conquer corruption, and to caſt out luſts! and the very ſmell of my luſts is ready to choak me; and which is worſe, I can ſcarce maſter my worke; nay it almoſt over-maſters me; yea and I have cryed more then once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>thrice have I beſought Chriſt,</hi> and yet I labour in this worke, and can doe but little at it.</p>
               <p>Be it ſo (O working ſoule!) yet Chriſt is and will be kinde. <hi>His grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee, and his ſtrength ſhall be perfected in thy weakneſſe,</hi> as 'tis <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 12.9. He will inable thee in time to maſter thy worke. <hi>Sinne ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102972:53"/>not have dominion over thee,</hi> Rom. 6.14. Thou ſhalt be made Lord over thy <hi>luſts.</hi> There is a <hi>blood of ſprinkling</hi> which ſhall <hi>cleanſe</hi> thy <hi>kennell.</hi> Thou <hi>reſiſteſt</hi> thy ſinne <hi>unto blood,</hi> and thou doſt <hi>bleed</hi> while at worke againſt corruption, yet it remaines (thou ſayeſt.) But know ſtill Chriſt is ſweet, and his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to thee ſhall be ſo. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though all thy <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>ſweat</hi> will not <hi>cleanſe</hi> thy ſoul, nor do away thy <hi>ſinne;</hi> yet the <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt ſhall, as 'tis 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But oh! (ſaith another ſoule) I am at harder worke then this: Its my worke to war with the <hi>Wolfe:</hi> I am labouring againſt <hi>Sathan.</hi> Many temptations daily beſet me. Not any meſſenger of Sathan, but Sathan himſelfe doth beſet me. Surely (you will ſay) my worke is grievous; is it not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> True, but <hi>thy Lord is gracious.</hi> Chriſt is with thee all this while (O working ſoule!) He hath promiſed thee to <hi>make away for thy eſcape,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.12. you may expect kinde carriage even while you are in this worke, and know that he will helpe you to goe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102972:54"/>through with it. <hi>The very God of peace will</hi> (or ſhall) <hi>ſhortly tread down Sathan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your feet,</hi> Ro. 16.20. It may be Sathan doth ſtand ready to devour that <hi>bleſſed birth,</hi> wherewith thou <hi>travelleſt;</hi> but know, Chriſt is near alſo, and he will help thee. Build upon it (O thou working beleever!) Chriſts carriage ſhall be kinde unto thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> Nay but (ſaith another work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoule) I have been labouring a long while; the work about which I have been ſet is almoſt over, but firſt I want a little ſtrength to perfect it; and ſecondly, I am in much feare whether when 'tis done it ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Now this grieves me, this troubles me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Well, but hear O ſoul! thou art at worke for a kinde and ſweet Maſter, who will helpe thee with ſtrength to perfect thy worke, and crowne thy worke with acceptation when perfected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For helpe:</hi> Know he will worke all our workes for us, and in us, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 12. He will <hi>worke in you both to will and to doe, and that of his good pleaſure,</hi> Philip. 2.13. yea the Spirit of Chriſt (which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102972:54"/>is the <hi>power from on high) ſhall helpe our infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26. This is the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt whom ye ſerve, that never did any ſervant faile in his worke, for want of his helpe. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For acceptance.</hi> Be confident O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever! Chriſt will accept of every endeavour of thine in his worke. Its Chriſts nature to accept of what we have, and not to looke for what we have not. <hi>Pigeons are welcome, where Lambs are wanting. Sighs are ſweet, and groans are acceptable unto him.</hi> Yea in Chriſts worke, <hi>Voluiſſe ſat eſt.</hi> A wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde is accepted.<note place="margin">

Yea <hi>John</hi> tells that if we (<hi>i.e.</hi> thoſe whoſe fellowſhip is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and who walke in the light, and have fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8.</p>
               <p>So that there being in Saints the <hi>ſeed</hi> of ſinne; there may be a ſinfull <hi>conception</hi> ſometimes in them; and they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102972:56"/>may be <hi>big with young</hi> in that ſenſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all our ſteppings aſide from Chriſt (eſpecially unto ſin) is called in the Scripture <hi>a whoring, and adultery.</hi> So that it will be no ſtraining of the Metaphor in the <hi>text;</hi> I am ſure 'twill be no deviation from <hi>truth,</hi> to ſay that Chriſt <hi>carries</hi> himſelfe <hi>ſweetly,</hi> and <hi>deales gently,</hi> even with thoſe, who have beene, or are <hi>weake,</hi> by their being <hi>big with young</hi> in a ſinfull ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The thing therefore which I ſhall now ſpeake unto is this, That</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſts carriage is ſweet even to thoſe members of his who are weake by their falls into ſin.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Some things premiſed for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the point, and the proof of it.</head>
               <p>THat I may the more clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without miſtake, and make good the Doctrine. I ſhall premiſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That the beſt beleevers are liable unto falls into ſinne.</hi> Even the choiſeſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102972:57"/>Saints, may ſometimes either by more <hi>violent rapes,</hi> or <hi>ſecret temptations,</hi> be <hi>big with young</hi> with ſinne. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that a <hi>juſt man falleth ſeven times,</hi> Prov. 24.16. In the caſe of <hi>Bathſheba, David</hi> himſelfe did <hi>conceive,</hi> and he was <hi>big with young</hi> by ſinne. Its true, Saints by reaſon of that <hi>immortall ſeed</hi> of grace within them, doe not, indeed cannot make a <hi>trade</hi> of this; they are not (as I may ſay) common <hi>Strumpers;</hi> they doe not make this <hi>ſpirituall</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> did not that literall) <hi>adultery</hi> their trade: yet ſtill I ſay 'tis poſſible that ſometimes they may, and indeed are overtaken this way. Albeit grace doe ſometime render the <hi>conceptions</hi> of ſin <hi>abortive,</hi> and moſtly doth kill them as ſoon as borne; daſhing the <hi>brats</hi> of ſinne (while young) againſt the ſtone, breaking them upon crucified Jeſus (that I may allude in a ſpirituall ſenſe to that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. <hi>ult.</hi>) Notwithſtanding all this I ſay, yet ſo it too, too often is, that even Saints, and true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt doe fall into ſin, or as the phraſe is doe <hi>conceive</hi> and <hi>bring forth</hi> that which is ſinne. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and conſcience witneſſe unto
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102972:57"/>this, that even ſuch as are <hi>borne of God,</hi> doe ſometimes beare ſinne. That is one thing which I premiſe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Beleevers by falling into ſin, do become weak:</hi> Their <hi>being big</hi> doth render them <hi>feeble.</hi> As breeding and bearing in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe do much weaken; ſo doth it alſo in a ſpiritual ſenſe. <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> go together, and every bringing forth is with pain. Sin is the greateſt weakner that can be. The ſoul is moſt unhealthfull when, and while ſinfull. Sin makes <hi>feeble hands,</hi> and <hi>weake knees.</hi> The very <hi>habits</hi> of grace (which are our new birth ſtrength) are exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated by the acts of ſin. <hi>David</hi> after his <hi>lying in</hi> with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> was much weakned; there was no <hi>health in his bones by reaſon of that breeding.</hi> Any fall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens in a degree.<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.3.</note> Saints ſinnings are their <hi>fallings: David broke</hi> his <hi>bones</hi> by ſin. Strong men are oftentimes weak by fals which they have taken, and Saints otherwiſe ſtrong, are yet very weak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their falls into ſinne. Indeed <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> is <hi>weakneſſe.</hi> How weake is the ſoule after ſin! How little a puſh of temptation throwes it down! How eaſily is <hi>David</hi> being weakned with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102972:58"/>
                  <hi>adulterous conceptions,</hi> overthrowne by <hi>murderius ſuggeſtions!</hi> And how long was it after that ere he could worke againe? Till <hi>Nathan</hi> came to viſit him (as is gathered from the title of the 51. Pſalme) <hi>David</hi> had made no ſong. He was ſo weake, as till then he could not worke: <hi>Nathans viſit was</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>Davids up-riſing.</hi> It ſeemes he <hi>lay in</hi> long upon that ſin, and was ſo weake thereby, as that he could not worke, till the Prophet rouzed and raiſed him up. Surely his ſinne did make him very weake. Beleevers! I thinke you will ſeal to this; that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings make you feeble; wickedneſſe renders you weaklings: your fighings ſay tis true. This is the ſecond thing I would premiſe.</p>
               <p>3. The next is this, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is diſpleaſed with beleevers ſinne.</hi> Adultery is diſpleaſing to the husband. Chriſt is your <hi>husband</hi> (Beleevers) and he cannot but be angry with your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, for they are your <hi>adulteries.</hi> Chriſt cannot ſmile upon your ſinfull brats. <hi>'Twere unhusband-like in him, not to be offended at them.</hi> The Lord Jeſus loves chaſte ſoules. To be <hi>ſpiritually barren,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102972:58"/>or ſinfully big are both alike diſpleaſing to Chriſt.</hi> As he is angry, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qeive, not by him, ſo he is offended if he ſee us conceive by ſinne. Not to abound in good fruit is a failing; but to have any bad fruit is a fault. You who have at any time been big with young in a ſinfull ſenſe; tell me, dare you ſay Chriſt ever liked it? nay was he not offended at it?<note place="margin">Omnis amor continet in ſe aliquid odii.</note> Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs loath bad conceptions, and bringings forth, becauſe he loves good ones. Its certainly the weakeneſſe and wantonneſſe of ſome that thinke and ſpeake otherwiſe. Chriſts anger and ſin goe together. <hi>Thou waſt a God that forgaveſt, though thou to okeſt vengeance of their inventions.</hi> 'Tis ſpoken of Chriſt (who is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us, or the <hi>Lord our God</hi>) Pſal. 99 8. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I premiſe in the third place, that Jeſus Chriſt (though well pleaſed in the maine with beleevers, yet he) is diſpleaſed with them, when they have rendred themſelves weake by ſinne. Chriſt likes not to ſee corruption rocked in the cradle. He loves not to ſee <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Bathſhebas</hi> boſome; Chriſt though he loves ſinners, yet loaths
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102972:59"/>ſins; he is diſpleaſed with the ſinnes, though pleaſed with the perſons of his people. Thus being premiſed, I ſhall now prove the point, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſts carriage is ſweet, even is thoſe members of his, who are weake by falls into ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> will be a proofe to this. <hi>Deare ſoule!</hi> Sathan got leave to <hi>winnow</hi> him, and he <hi>weakned</hi> him. Yet Chriſt was very ſweet for all that. I ſuppoſe you know his fall, 'twas great. <hi>He denies Chriſt,</hi> and ſweares he knew him not. There's one degree. <hi>He ſtands to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,</hi> and is not aſhamed of what he had ſaid, but lyes, and ſayes, <hi>he was not one of them that belonged to Chriſt.</hi> Ah Lord, how he tumbles downe! yet he falls a ſtep lower: He begins to curſe himſelfe (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>i. e.</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and anathematize himſelfe, if he were, &amp;c. what a fall is here! Surely <hi>Peter</hi> brake his bones (though Chriſt which was his ſweetneſſe kept his necke) with this fall. How weake was he by his wickedneſſe? The Damoſell that looked upon him, and ſpake to him, ſurely raped his ſoule. <hi>He conceived ſinne, and brought forth a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102972:59"/>lye:</hi> and he was very <hi>big with young,</hi> for the lye was very great. Well, yet Chriſt <hi>led him gently:</hi> He looked on him graciouſly. Chriſt was ſweet, though <hi>Peter</hi> was ſinfull. Doubtleſſe <hi>Peter</hi> felt his bones broken by that fall, ſurely he was weake, and that made him <hi>weep bitterly:</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſt was very ſweet in his carriage towards him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left ſpeciall word with the Angell, to bid the women tell his Diſciples, and <hi>Peter (ſpecialliter dicit &amp; Petro)</hi> of his Reſurrection, and going to <hi>Galilee</hi> to meet them, and him. Chriſt prayed for him before he fell, in an eſpeciall manner (<hi>I have prayed for thee,</hi> ſaith he) and looked upon him after he fell. Mindes him at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confers ſweetly with him before the Aſcention, Joh. 20.) Shall I need to adde more, to let you ſee how ſweet Chriſt is to beleevers, weakned by falls into ſin.</p>
               <p>'Twas ſingular ſweetneſſe in Chriſt towards thoſe <hi>ſeven Churches</hi> that fell, and were much weakned by their falls. He looked upon them all, and wrote to them all; and however ſome
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102972:60"/>paſſages in his Epiſtles to them were ſevere, yet the very writing of them, and the end thereof was ſweet.</p>
               <p>I will adde but on Scripture to prove this point, yet more. 'Tis, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſſe I was wroth and ſmote him</hi> (Chriſt I ſaid before, is diſpleaſed with his members ſinnings) <hi>and be went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> Ah Lord! what weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is here, to grow worſe for whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? yet ſee Chriſt is ſweet for all this. <hi>I have ſeene his wayes, and I will heale him: I will lead him alſo,</hi> v. 18. Juſt almoſt as 'tis in the text; <hi>he will gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is Idolatry; to be big with this, is abominable (Chriſt was wroth to ſee it) but to harden the heart under chaſtiſements is worſe: Surely a ſoul thus fallen, is very weak; yet even to ſuch ſoules Chriſt is ſweet, his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage kinde; for even thoſe <hi>he heales,</hi> theſe <hi>he leads,</hi> and to thoſe he <hi>reſtores comforts.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> One generall demonſtration of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſts carriage to ſinning Beleevers.</head>
               <p>HAving cleared the point a little in the intent thereof; and having alſo offered ſomething for the proofe thereof, I ſhall now further demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the tenderneſſe of Chriſt bowels unto ſin-weakned ſoules, in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage unto them both generally and particularly.</p>
               <p>Generally. Conſider how that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt takes much paines, and lets out mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull power for the raiſing of fallen belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and for the gathering of wandring Lambs:</hi> And this conſidered, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Chriſts ſweetneſſe at firſt ſight. Sinning ſoules, Chriſt will not loſe you. Though you through weakneſſe <hi>wander</hi> from him, hee'l not let you goe: Hee'l <hi>walke after</hi> you, while you wander; and becauſe hee's ſweet, hee'l <hi>gather</hi> you from your ſinnes. He that <hi>gathers</hi> weake <hi>Lambs</hi> with his great <hi>arme,</hi> will gather alſo wandring <hi>Ewes</hi> with his <hi>ſhepherds crooke.</hi> You know
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102972:61"/>the parable of the <hi>loſt ſheep,</hi> Luke 15. it concernes you who have gone <hi>aſtray</hi> from your Lords fold. Beleever, thou ſayeſt thou haſt wandred in the wayes of ſinne, and art a <hi>loſt ſheep</hi> (that is loſt in thy owne ſenſe) know thy Shepherd is ſweet, and will not loſe thee, hee'l ſeem rather for a while to leave others, that he may ſeek thee. When <hi>Antigonus</hi> a King paſſing by a ditch into which a ſheep was fallen, the Hiſtorian ſaith, he pulled it out (though dirty) with his own hands: and for this he was exceedingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and commended of his ſubjects. <hi>Heavenly ſheep,</hi> your King is kinder. Hee'l not onely ſtoop to filthy ditches of ſinne into which you fall, and take you out with his armes, but hee'l lay you in his boſome, that he may waſh you with his bloud. He deales not thus with all ſinners; but hee'l deale thus with you. <hi>Judas</hi> falls into one ☞ ditch, he betrayes his Maſter. <hi>Peter</hi> falls into another, he denyes his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Chriſt lets <hi>Judas</hi> lye, but takes up <hi>Peter.</hi> Minde this, O ye poore of the flocke! Though Chriſt let <hi>Judaſe's</hi> fall and periſh, Hee'l gather his <hi>Peters</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:102972:61"/>Say now, is not Chriſt ſweet in his carriage towards his owne, even when they ſinne? It may be thy ſoule hath been ſtragling abroad (<hi>Dinah</hi> like) and ſome corruptions or temptations (<hi>Schechem</hi> like) have <hi>humbled thee,</hi> ſo that thou art <hi>big with young:</hi> Now how is it with thy ſoule? It't not very weake? Doth not joy faint, and faith flag? Art not ready to ſay, Chriſt will whip me for my wandring? Hee'l be ſorely diſpleaſed with me. I dare not ſay Chriſt is not diſpleaſed at this: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his <hi>Spirit is grieved (Jacob</hi> like) at this; yet let me tell you, he is ſweet, and ſo will be notwithſtanding this. Adde not weakneſſe to weakneſſe: ſay not, Chriſt will never be ſweet more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſinned now: But know, he is and will be ſweet in this, that hee'l be avenged on the head of ſin, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing thee. Hee'l take thee into his heart, and caſt that whereof thou art big out of thine: Say beleevers, after ſinnings, hath not Chriſt made you moſt out of love with ſinne? Have not you <hi>hated it after, more then ever you loved it before? Ephraim</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>what have I any more to doe with Idols,</hi> Hoſ. 14.8. Hath not Chriſt made you, to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102972:62"/>defile that which defiled you? and have not you <hi>caſt it away</hi> as a <hi>menſtruous</hi> cloath; ſaying unto it, <hi>Get thee hence?</hi> as 'tis <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.22. How hath Chriſt ſhewed all his <hi>ſeverity</hi> againſt your ſins of which you were <hi>big?</hi> and how hath he meane while been good unto your ſoules: He hath, and doth deale grievouſly with your ſinnes, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; but he deales graciouſly with you, gathering you. Witneſſe to the ſweetneſſe of your Shepherd, O ye <hi>ſinning Ewes,</hi> who have been <hi>big with young:</hi> Hath not he gone after you, and found you, and laid you on his <hi>ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders rejoycing?</hi> Hath he not dealt with you as with <hi>David:</hi> when you went <hi>aſtray like lost ſheep, did not he ſeeke you?</hi> Pſal. 119.176. And when he found you, did he deale with you according to your finfulneſſe? Did he whip you all the way home? Rather did he not <hi>lead you gently?</hi> Now doth not this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate undeniably, Chriſts ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to you, O ye ſinfull beleevers! If Jeſus Chriſt, after <hi>luſt hath conceived in us, and brought forth ſin,</hi> ſhould leave us to our ſelves, till <hi>ſinne being finiſhed, ſhould bring forth death,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Janes</hi> 1.15.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102972:62"/>If Chriſt I ſay, ſhould deale thus with us, could we deny his <hi>Juſtice?</hi> But now for Chriſt, even when we have been <hi>big</hi> of ſin, to <hi>lead</hi> us <hi>gently;</hi> not to <hi>leave</hi> us to our ſin, but to gather us out of it, and to raiſe us after it; ſurely this doth declare his ſweetneſſe. But this is onely a generall demonſtration; I ſhall therefore adde ſome particular ones.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Some particular demonſtrations of Chriſts ſweet carriage unto beleevers weake by ſinning.</head>
               <p>THe firſt thing wherein Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his ſweetneſſe unto ſinning beleevers is, <hi>his chaſtening of them for their ſinnings. Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>he that ſpareth the rod [hateth] his ſon, but he that [loveth] him, chaſteneth him betimes,</hi> Prov. 13.24. <hi>Chaſtiſement for ſinne is a priviledge peculiar to Saints:</hi> Its <hi>childrens bread; Baſtards</hi> go without it, and this <hi>bread</hi> (as I may ſay) of <hi>affliction</hi> doth Chriſt give his members after ſinning. And that this is ſweet dealing will appear, if you conſider,</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:102972:63"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Its Covenant priviledge, promiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy,</hi> ſo ſaith the Text. <hi>If thy children forſake my Law, &amp;c. If they breake my Statutes, &amp;c. [Then] I will viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes,</hi> Pſal. 89.30, 31, 32. Beleevers, Chriſt deals ſweetly with you, when he chaſtiſeth you after falls into ſin. Hee'l chaſtiſe you with the rod: Its true, hee'l <hi>not caſt you off</hi> for your ſinnes; no, nor whip you with Scorpions; yet hee'l chaſtiſe you (for every one whom he receiveth after fals, he deals ſo with for the moſt part) His rod (not of iron but) <hi>of men,</hi> ſhall be upon you; and thoſe <hi>ſtripes</hi> wherewith hee'l <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten</hi> you, ſhall be <hi>the ſtripes of the children of men,</hi> as 'tis 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. where that in the Pſalme is taken. So that Chriſt deals ſweetly with you, when after your ſinnings he chaſtiſeth you for his Covenant priviledge. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis denyed to others:</hi> Chriſt deals not thus ſweetly with all ſinners. They ſinne, and are not in ſorrowes as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Its the <hi>thundring voice of wrath</hi> (as <hi>Origen</hi> obſerves) that ſaith, <hi>I will not puniſh your daughters when they commit whoredome,</hi> Hoſ. 4.14. Sinners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102972:63"/>
                  <hi>whoredome,</hi> and are not <hi>puniſhed;</hi> Saints are but <hi>big with young,</hi> and <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed.</hi> Indeed thoſe <hi>onely</hi> hath Chriſt <hi>knowne of all the families of the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 3.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings for ſin are Chriſts viſits of the ſoule.</note> and therefore he puniſheth them, that is (as the Hebrew word ſignifies) viſits them. Beleevers, Chriſt lets others ſinne, and comes not neare them: Its his wrath. But you fall and ſinne, and Chriſt <hi>viſits</hi> you, take it as his love. He does more for you, then for them; and its ſweet dealing. This then is the firſt particular. <hi>Chriſt carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſweetly unto ſinning beleevers, in that he chaſtiſeth them for their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed his <hi>chaſtiſements</hi> are their <hi>meltings,</hi> they ſerve to <hi>purge</hi> them from their ſinnes; and how elſe, or what elſe <hi>ſhould he doe for the daughter of his people,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7. Its the care and tenderneſſe of the husbandman to lop and cut corrupt branches: And its Chriſts care over you (and when he declares it, he ſhews ſweetneſſe to you beleevers) to cut you, either when you are not fruitfull in good, or when your buddings are bad. <hi>And this is the fruit of all to take away ſin,</hi> Iſa. 27.9. Now ſurely this is ſweer. There
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102972:64"/>is a difference between <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Its one thing to cut, another thing to cut off. Its maternall and ſweet to give the ſicke childe a Pill (though bitter) to purge out <hi>corrupt bumors</hi> that hinder health. Beleevers! Chriſt ſhould not be as tender as a <hi>mother</hi> (and yet he makes himſelfe more, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 49.15.) if he ſhould not <hi>purge you,</hi> after ſinnings, <hi>i.e.</hi> chaſtiſe you, <hi>For by this is the iniquity of Jacob purged,</hi> Eſa, 27.9. And how ſweet doth Chriſt deal with ſinning Saints in <hi>purging</hi> them from their ſinnes, while he lets others lye, and <hi>rot,</hi> and periſh, for want of <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purges.</hi> But.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Jeſus Chriſt calls you, and ſaith, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto the Lord your God, for you are falne by your iniquities,</hi> Hoſ. 14.1. Go and ſay, <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God,</hi> Jer. 3.22. What though you have ſinned, yet hee's a Saviour: As all your ſinnes before converſion, did not keepe Chriſt from comming to you; ſo neither let your ſinnes ſince, keep you from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. <hi>He is ſtill the ſame in ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, be you the ſame in faith.</hi> Why tarry you, O <hi>wanderers!</hi> why enter you not the folds of Jeſus? call out ſome one that was once in your caſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether Chriſt did deal kindly with him. Doubt not, <hi>Oh ye of little faith!</hi> but he will be ſo to you. He u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be ſweet to all the weake of his flocke, and in particular to ſuch as you who are weakned by ſins.

               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:102972:76"/>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Let this doctrine perſwade Japhet to dwell in the tents of Shem:</hi> my meaning is, that thoſe who as yet are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrangers unto Chriſt, ſhould come in unto him; you who as yet never knew what it was to be <hi>infolded in the boſome of Jeſus,</hi> who as yet were never <hi>Lambs</hi> nor <hi>Ewes</hi> in Chriſts fold. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſweetneſſe of this Shepherd, and come into him. Sathan deales ſeemingly ſweet, that he may draw you into ſin, but in the end he will be really bitter to you. Chriſt indeed is ſeemingly bitter, to keep you from ſin, hedging up your way with thorns. But hee'l be really ſweet, if you come into his flock, even notwithſtanding your ſins. Thou lookeſt into Chriſts fold, and thou ſeeſt it hedged, and fenced all about to keep you in from ſin, and this keeps thee from entring: But oh! let it not. Chriſt indeed is unwilling that any of his ſhould wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and if they be unwilling too, its well. And if they wander, hee'l fetch them in, it may be with his <hi>Shepherds dog</hi> (ſome affliction) but yet hee'l not be (as we ſay) <hi>dogged</hi> himſelfe: No, he is, and will be ſweet. It may be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102972:77"/>now Sathan ſmiles, and is pleaſant to you while you ſin, but know hee'l be bitter in the end: He that ſings <hi>Cyrene-like</hi> now, will devoure <hi>Lyon-like</hi> at laſt. Hee'l torment you and vexe you, and be burning and bitterneſſe to you. Oh come in therefore to Jeſus Chriſt, let him be now the Shepherd of thy ſoule: And know then, hee'l be ſweet in endeavouring to keep thee from ſin, before thou commit it; and hee'l be ſweet in delivering thee from ſin after thou haſt committed it. Oh that this thought that Jeſus Chriſt is ſweet in his carriage unto all his members, unto all of his flocke, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſinning ones; might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the hearts of ſome ſinners to come in unto his fold.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Somethings premiſed, and the poynt gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proved.</head>
               <p>I will in ſome ſteps aſcend to the truth in hand. Two things I ſhall premiſe as preparatory to the proof, by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of objections.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This firſt I premiſe, <hi>viz. Chriſt permits his choiceſt members many times to meet with ſharpe ſufferings for his ſake, and the Goſpels.</hi> Sometimes hee gives the <hi>dearly beloved of his ſoul into the hands of her enemies Jer.</hi> 12.7. 'Twas a ſpeech ſpake by Chriſt himſelfe unto his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that in the world they ſhould have tribulations, <hi>Job.</hi> 16.33. The paſtor prophecied to all his flocke, when he ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall be hated of all Nations for my names ſake, Mat.</hi> 24.9, <hi>John</hi> was the <hi>boſome-beloved,</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> yet hee muſt to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102972:79"/>
                  <hi>Patmos,</hi> and there be a <hi>companion</hi> (with ſuffering Saints) <hi>in tribulation, Apoca.</hi> 1.9. Your Shepherd (O ye heavenly flock!) may permit you to walke in the vallie of the ſhaddow of death. Chriſts <hi>lambs</hi> are ſometimes worried by the <hi>dogs.</hi> I ſhall not need to expatiate. Surely Saints, its no myſtery unto you. Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings every where meet with you. This <hi>Paul</hi> knew, that the Holy-Ghoſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed <hi>every where, that bonds and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did waite for him, Act.</hi> 20.23. What a bloody bed-role is that? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.24. And <hi>Stripes, Priſons, Rods, deeps, Perills</hi> of all ſorts, and from all ſorts, theſe and the like <hi>Paul</hi> met almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, This is the firſt word I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is this, <hi>That this is conſiſtent with Chriſts ſweetneſſe.</hi> Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers you may be precious in Chriſts eies though in perſecutions. <hi>Ieſus</hi> is a <hi>belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> though you are in <hi>blood:</hi> Though he permit you to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> yet he is <hi>ſweet.</hi> Himſelfe was the <hi>deare-one</hi> of the father, yet he ſuffered, and his father was ſtill <hi>deare.</hi> Chriſts ſufferings were conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his fathers ſweetneſſe; and yours are with his. <hi>To you it is given, not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102972:80"/>only to beleeve on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake,</hi> as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. Affliction is a gift of <hi>love</hi> even as faith is. Its grace as wel to <hi>bleed</hi> for, as to <hi>beleeve</hi> in Chriſt. It may be fair over head, when, &amp; while foule under foot. In a bad way a man may have good weather. A faire skie, and a filthie way may conſiſt. The Shepherd may <hi>pipe,</hi> though the dogge <hi>barke.</hi> Build upon it ye ſuffering Saints! Chriſt may be ſweet, though you ſuffer. Though your cup be bloody, he dranke firſt, and ſurely for the ſervant to drink of no worſe then the Maſter, its not hard. Admit men are unkinde, yet Chriſt abideth kind, yea, although hee ſuffer men to deale harſhly with you, he is mercifull ſtill. Their <hi>malice</hi> doth not make voide his <hi>mercy.</hi> Its a fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of arguing, becauſe you ſuffer, therefore Chriſt is not ſweet. No, your ſufferings, and Chriſts ſweetneſſe may ſtand together.</p>
               <p>If you aske how can this bee? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, well enough. And this I ſhall prove.</p>
               <p>The phraſe in the Text includes two things, tending to conſume this truth,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102972:80"/>viz,

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Preſence,</hi> Chriſt is with his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in all their miſeries (he could not elſe <hi>lead them</hi>). Saints in their ſaddeſt ſufferings, in their ſoreſt perſecutions, have Chriſts preſence, <hi>when thou paſſeſt thorow the waters I will be with thee,</hi> and <hi>Iſay</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

When the three children were in the furnace, Chriſt was there to make the fourth. <hi>I ſee foure men looſe, walking in the middeſt of the fire, and the forme of the fourth is like the ſon of God. Dan.</hi> 3.25. Chriſt you ſee was ſo ſweet as to be in the fire with thoſe Saints. And it ſeems he <hi>led them</hi> there, for tis ſaid they <hi>walked. Iohn</hi> was <hi>in the Iſle called</hi> Patmos, <hi>for the word of God, and for the testimony of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Apoc.</hi> 1, 9. And Chriſt was there too, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. <hi>David</hi> knew well this ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt his Shepherd: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee aſſures and comforts himſelfe with this: That though he were <hi>in the vale of the ſhadow of death,</hi> yet Chriſt would bee with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. But</p>
               <p n="2">2 Chriſt is not only preſent, but <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partingly preſent</hi> with his in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Chriſt <hi>leades his gently,</hi> while they ſuffer grievouſly. This <hi>David</hi> alſo knew
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102972:81"/>and therefore he ſaith, <hi>thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaffe they comfort mee.</hi> Saints are weake in ſufferings; ſo weak that they cannot ſwim (at leaſt) long. But Chriſt will keep them from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Feeble feete can hardly goe upon rockie ground, If ſome bodie doe not ſupport, they will fall. That the feet of the Saints may not ſlide, and they fall under, or in ſufferings, Chriſt will be preſent (for hee <hi>keepeth the feet of the Saints</hi>) and lead them. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> though men were ſo weak as to <hi>deſert</hi> him, when he was to anſwer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nero,</hi> yet Chriſt was ſo kind as to be preſent with him, and to <hi>ſupport</hi> him. He ſpeaks of it with a <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, though all ſhamefully ſhrunk back, and forſook me, yet <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Lord</hi> (ſweetly) <hi>ſtood by me, and ſupported mee,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. Speak Saints! in your ſufferings to have Chriſts <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and <hi>ſupport,</hi> is it not ſweet? When you paſſe through fire and water (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.12) to have Chriſt to go along with you, and to <hi>lead you gently,</hi> is it not glorious? why, this others have had; and you ſhall have, to let you ſee this as true, that <hi>Chriſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> One great inſtance to prove the point.</head>
               <p>I Deſire to let you ſee the truth of the point fully: Therefore I ſhall lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you one great inſtance in which you may ſee it plainly.</p>
               <p>I will inſtance in Chriſts carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Diſciples (who were to ſuffer upon his departure.) And you ſhall ſee how ſweet it was.</p>
               <p>There are five particulars in which Chriſt did ſweetly declare himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Diſciples, with reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe ſufferings, that hee knew they would meet withall, for his ſake, in the World, as ſoone as he departed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He gave them not onely reall, but royall teſtimonies of his love.</hi> In that he waſhed their feet, and ſerves them: In that he inſtituted his ſupper, and feaſts them. And in that forgetting his owne ſufferings, he comforted them. <hi>When Ieſus knew that his houre was come</hi> (faith the Scripture) Chriſt knew that this was the <hi>hour and power of darkeneſſe</hi> (as he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102972:82"/>calls it). He knew that hee was now to ſuffer: and that upon this, his Diſciples would be ſcattered, yet even now; <hi>Having loved his owne he loves, them to the end.</hi> He doth not withdraw from them to ſpend this houre in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe: but he ſpends it in loving them. Have you ever heard of one who being ready to ſuffer death himſelfe, and who had but one night, ere he ſhould be taken, and yet did ſpend that one night, and all that night in <hi>waſhing, feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, comforting</hi> ſome others. Why Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: Jeſus Chriſt was ſuch an one, when the houre was come, and he knew it, that he muſt be taken and dragged to ſuffering: he forgets (as it were) him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And ſpends all the time in <hi>feaſting</hi> and <hi>chearing</hi> his Diſciples, as if he were rather ſenſible of theirs then of his own ſufferings. All this is clear out of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13 and 14. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He fore-warnes them of all, even the worſt of thoſe evills that they ſhould ſuffer.</hi> There was not a <hi>pricke, a Stone</hi> in the way in which they ſhould go, but hee acquaints them with it. He tells them how that the world would <hi>hate</hi> them, <hi>perſecute</hi> them, <hi>excommunicate</hi> them
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102972:82"/>yea, kill them. How ſweet is hee? to tell them the ſaddeſt things before-hand that when they meet with them they might not bee <hi>offended,</hi> that is (as the word <hi>John</hi> 1.16. will bear) ſo <hi>ſcandaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> as to fall. Chriſt tells them all the <hi>rubs</hi> in the way, that when they meet with them, they might not falover them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (having forewarned them of the ſufferings they ſhould meet withall) <hi>he gives them comforts to ſweeten thoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As
<list>
                     <item>1. He aſſures them that (though he left them) they <hi>ſhould not bee as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,</hi> without a Tutor, or Guardian.</item>
                     <item>2. That therefore, <hi>hee would ſend them the holy Ghoſt,</hi> who ſhould both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and take care of them, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.16.18.</item>
                  </list>
To this he addes, that they were near to him, even as neare as the <hi>branches to the Vine.</hi> And that therefore they ſhould ſuffer no worſe <hi>then himſelfe did, Iohn</hi> 15.1.20. Leſt they ſhould bee borne downe with the thoughts of the length of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he tells them that it ſhould be but ſhort, and though the ſenſe might bee ſharpe, yet the <hi>iſſue</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſweet.</hi> To this end he tells them that their <hi>ſorrow ſhould be turned into joy:</hi> And that they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102972:83"/>ſhould bee but <hi>as a woman in travaile,</hi> whoſe ſorrow is meaſured by an houre (as is hinted in that expreſſion, <hi>when her houre is come</hi>) but whoſe <hi>joy</hi> ſhould bee ſuch, as that it ſhould <hi>ſwallow up</hi> that ſorrow, and <hi>make her forget it, Ioh.</hi> 16.16. To this he joynes, that as their <hi>ſorrow</hi> ſhould have an <hi>end,</hi> ſo their <hi>joy</hi> ſhould have <hi>none,</hi> for it ſhould be ſuch as <hi>none could take from them,</hi> verſ. 22. Thus hee cheares their hearts againſt that feare of ſorrow which had <hi>filled</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After all this, <hi>He bends his knees to his father, and prays for them, Ioh.</hi> 17. And how far-paſſing ſweet was he in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! Obſerve, he intreates the father to <hi>keep them</hi> from the ſting of ſufferings, <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>evill of the world.</hi> verſ. 15. And that the father would grant them that, which is the <hi>myſtery of glory,</hi> i.e. union to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>that they may bee one as thou father art in mee, and I in thee; I in them, and thou in mee,</hi> verſ. 21.23. And (as if all this were not enough) he <hi>wills</hi> it: That they might have as <hi>glorious a Manſion</hi> as himſelfe, and that they might have the <hi>ſame glory</hi> that he had with the <hi>father</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World was, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. Thus he powres out his heart in prayer for them
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102972:83"/>And which is conſiderable, this he did in their audience (as the context ſhewes) O how were the Diſciples hearts raviſhed thinke you all the while!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, that he might yet ſhew them more ſweetneſſe: <hi>He actually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth himſelfe to ſufferings, and be offereth himſelf to free them. If ye ſeek me let theſe goe their way,</hi> Joh. 16.8. So he ſuffers, that they might not; he takes the blows on himſelfe, to keep them off from them. And this ſtill he doth ſpiritually; for all our ſufferings are rather the <hi>remainder of Chriſts afflictions,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Col.</hi> 1.29. then our owne.</p>
               <p>So that now put all this together, and parabolically (yet plainly) it ſpeakes thus, There was a great Captaine to fight a bloody battell (in which by being conquered, he would get the day) he knew that himſelfe ſhould be taken in the firſt onſet, and that afterwards he ſhould be ſlaine; yet for all this, ſome few houres before the enemy fell on, he feaſts his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſerves them himſelfe in that feaſt. Tells them of all the worſt the enemy would, or could doe; ſpends
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102972:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>his oratory in making a long and ſweet ſpeech to incourage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you: Tells them plainly that he ſhould be taken and ſlaine; yet aſſures them of another Comforter and Cheiftaine. In the midſt of them lifts up his eyes to heaven: And (as if he minded them more then himſelfe) prayes more for them, then for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Having done this, he prepares to meet the enemy. And as ſoone as they appeare, he approaches; and by giving himſelfe up as their priſoner, makes way for his Souldiers eſcape. Tell me, was not this a ſweet Captain? was not this ſweet carriage? Why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, the Parable is concerning the <hi>Captaine of your ſalvation,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. The prementioned particulars open and make good the Parable in all its parts; and doth not this parable prove the point? <hi>viz. That Chriſt is very ſweet to his ſorrowfull, ſuffering mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It appeares in this, <hi>That he ſecures your choiſeſt jeu ell in your ſoreſt ſuffering.</hi> Saints have a <hi>pearle of great price,</hi> which if they have ſecure, they feare no loſſe. This <hi>pearle</hi> is their <hi>ſoule;</hi> and this Chriſt ſecures in all their ſufferings. Upon this ground it is that he bids them not to feare. <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do,</hi> Luke 12.4. This he ſpake in the beginning of his Sermon, and that was intended to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as appears v.i. <hi>Tunde capſum Anaxarchi,</hi> ſaid the Martyr. Beleevers, all the <hi>threſhing</hi> of your enemies, can but beat away your <hi>huskes.</hi> The worſt that ſufferings can, or ſhall doe, is but on the worſt part, your <hi>vile body:</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102972:85"/>ſtill ſecures your beſt part, your ſoule. I know your cry in ſuffering: Is it not that, <hi>Deliver my ſoule from the ſword, my [Darling] from the power of the dog,</hi> Pſal. 22.20. Why beleevers, Chriſt will do this. He alway keeps that in <hi>his owne hand, and none can, or ſhall pull it thence.</hi> Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake; <hi>But there ſhall not a haire of your bead periſh,</hi> Luke 21.17, 18. Some expound this thus, you ſhall ſuffer much, but not in the maine; not a haire of your head (which may be an Hebraiſme for that which is the chief) ſhall periſh. Sure I am of this: That which is a Saints chiefe, is ſecured in the midſt of ſufferings. Beleevers, your enemies ſhall but bruiſe your <hi>heel,</hi> your worſer part, Chriſt will ſecure your <hi>head, i.e.</hi> your precious, prime, chiefe part. Your <hi>wood,</hi> and <hi>bay,</hi> and <hi>ſtubble;</hi> your poore, baſe, droſſie part may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer loſſe, but your precious things ſhall not.

               <p n="2">2. Chriſt carries himſelfe paſſing ſweet unto his ſuffering members; in that <hi>he gives them cordialls ſuitable to all their ſufferings.</hi> Its worth the noting, that as thoſe <hi>cordialls</hi> which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt gave to his Diſciples were ſweet, ſo they were <hi>ſuitable</hi> to what they ſhould ſuffer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2.

                  </gap> which was a ſolemne kinde of <hi>excommunication</hi> (above that which they called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:102972:86"/>unto this, Chriſt had told them, <hi>That he went to prepare manſions for them in his Fathers houſe,</hi> Joh. 14.2. In which he comforts them thus; Though you ſhall be <hi>caſt out</hi> of the Jewes <hi>Synagogues,</hi> yet you ſhall not be <hi>caſt</hi> out of my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe;</hi> I have prepared <hi>manſions</hi> for you there, be not therefore troubled at that. And for that ſuffering unto <hi>death</hi> (which was hinted in this, that men ſhould <hi>thinke they ſerved God in klling them,</hi> eſteeming belike your ſlaughter his ſervice) Chriſt! gives them a <hi>cordiall ſuitable</hi> unto this, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.19. where he aſſures them, that their <hi>lives</hi> ſhould be as <hi>ſure as his:</hi> For becauſe he lived, <hi>they ſhould live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> And however they might be <hi>killed,</hi> yet he would <hi>raiſe them up againe,</hi> as it is <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.

Beare up your hearts, ye bleeding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers! there are <hi>ſuitable cordialls</hi> for you in your Saviours boſome, and he will give them forth.

In all the ſufferings of Chriſts members, Chriſt carries himſelfe ſweetly to them in that <hi>he ſympathiſeth with them</hi> in all. <hi>In all their affliction, be was afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 53.9. Beleevers, ſuffer where, or when you will, Chriſt <hi>ſuffers</hi> there and then with you. Had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors eies, they would ſee this, But though they are blind, yet doe you beleeve. <hi>Paul</hi> thinkes he onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>women</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> But in them he perſecutes <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And though he knew it not at firſt, yet he did afterwards. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me,</hi> Act. 9.4. If we periſh, Chriſt periſheth with us (ſaid <hi>Luther.</hi>) Suffering Saints, Chriſt is ſo ſweet to you, as that he ſuffers with you. Are you in <hi>dungeons?</hi> Chriſt is there too. Is

All thoſe afflictions that <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25, 26. &amp;c. he puts them upon Chriſts ſcore, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.24. The <hi>Baptiſme</hi> of affliction wherewith you are <hi>baptiſed,</hi> is Chriſts. Count not, call not that yours, which is his.

Why, in <hi>Patmos,</hi> when he was there a <hi>companion</hi> (with ſufferers) in <hi>tribulations, Apoc.</hi> 2.9.12, 13. Its reported of one <hi>Theodorus</hi> that while he was on the racke, <hi>ſuffering,</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:102972:89"/>he was noted to continue <hi>ſmiling,</hi> and being asked how, or why, he ſmiled ſo, He anſwered, he ſaw a young-man all in white wiping from him his ſweat, &amp;c. <hi>Moſes</hi> endured, <hi>as ſeeing him who is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Heb. 11.27. The <hi>inviſible God</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares very <hi>viſible</hi> to Saints in ſufferings, and this helps them to endure. When was it that <hi>Stephen ſaw the glory of God, and Ieſus ſtanding at the right hand of God?</hi> was it not when his Enemies <hi>gnaſhed their teeth on him?</hi> Act. 7.54.55. <hi>There be divin comforts which are felt under the croſſe and not at other times</hi> (ſaid Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi>) The <hi>ſpirit of glory is to reſt on us,</hi> while reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as tis 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.

A ſweet Lord gives a weighty reward, for a light ſuffering. <hi>Paul</hi> was good at reckoning, and yet he ſaith, I <hi>reckon that the ſufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, are not worthy to bee compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18. <hi>Romanes</hi> may forget <hi>Marius</hi> both in ſervice and ſufferings, in <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>wounds.</hi> But Chriſt alwayes <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> his ſervants ſufferings, and rewards them, not for any worth that is in them, but for the ſweetneſſe which is in him.

               <p>Generall, if wee conſider, either the law of equity, the nature of <hi>relation;</hi> or the power of <hi>love,</hi> wee ſhall ſee that which is the ground of this point. 1. <hi>Its but equal that Chriſt ſhould carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus to them, who ſuffer for him.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would bee as free from ſufferings, as others, were it not for their Saviour. Did not they <hi>love</hi> him, none would hate them. They are <hi>hated for his ſake, Luke</hi> 21.17. Men <hi>reproach</hi> them, becauſe they <hi>honour</hi> him. When as you are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, perſecuted, and have all manner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſpoken againſt you falſly;</hi> Chriſt knows its for his ſake, as tis, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.15. Now
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102972:91"/>
                  <hi>Equity</hi> requires, that Chriſt ſhould deale ſweetly with them, who ſuffer thus ſharpely for him. Could, or would Saints deſert their ſervice of Chriſt; if they would but joyn with others to <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie</hi> him; they ſhould not need to feare any ſufferings themſelves, were it not that they obſerve his lawes, make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his <hi>ordinances,</hi> ſtand to his <hi>truth,</hi> maintaine his <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and alas, were it not for thoſe things; they might be as ſecure as others. They are good people, but they are <hi>Puritans,</hi> they are to be miſ-liked for nothing, but that they are <hi>preciſe.</hi> They might bee free from the curſe, would they renounce Chriſt. Hence it is that Jeſus Chriſt carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe thus tender to them, becauſe they are <hi>true</hi> to him: He cannot but ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their ſufferings, by his carriage to them, ſince they ſuffer for conſcience to him. How did the perſecutors of old, indeavour to perſwade Chriſtians, to deny Chriſt! what <hi>Serpentine ſubtlety</hi> with <hi>Sugered-poiſon-rhetoricke</hi> was uſed to make them deny him! what <hi>high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, vaſt wealth, alluring pleaſures</hi> were laid before them? And how did their adverſaries ſay, <hi>All theſe will wee give

But you cannot, will not, dare not <hi>deny</hi> Chriſt in any thing; and therefore it is that you ſuffer in every thing.

Should not Chriſt be ſweet and kinde to you in your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, he ſhould forget (but ſure he will not) why he was <hi>born.</hi> If you ſay <hi>there is a third friend that ſticketh cloſer then a brother,</hi> Prov. 18.24. I tell you Chriſt is your <hi>friend:</hi> and hee'l prove himſelfe ſo in your ſufferings. <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were <hi>friendly</hi> in their viſit, and compaſſion, though <hi>faulty</hi> in their charge. Chriſt will as <hi>friendly viſit</hi> you, and ſympathize with you, as they did; and be more ſweet in his carriage then they were. Hee'l not <hi>blame,</hi> but <hi>bleſſe</hi> you. Hee'l not adde affliction to affliction by his cenſures, as they did: but hee'l be ſweet in his carriage; for he knowes, <hi>that to him that is afflicted, pity is to be ſhewed by his friend,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Job</hi> 6.14. Suffering Saints, remember you are related to Chriſt, and that <hi>relation</hi> may be a <hi>reaſon,</hi> why you may conclude that hee'l carry himſelfe ſweetly to you in all your ſufferings. But</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Love conſtraines:</hi> Chriſt loves his owne, and his <hi>love to them will conſtraine him to be tender over them in their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi> The mothers <hi>love</hi> will open her <hi>boſome</hi> to give the childe her breaſt at any time, eſpecially when it <hi>cryes.</hi> Ye <hi>Martyrs in life</hi> (for there is a ſlaying all the day long, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36.) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your Maſters <hi>love.</hi> 'Tis very ſtrong, therefore hee'l be very ſweet.

If you be in baniſhment, his <hi>love</hi> will invent <hi>wings</hi> to <hi>flye</hi> after you, what ever be your ſufferings, his love will ſweeten them. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſweet to <hi>David,</hi> eſpecially while <hi>David</hi> was in his ſufferings: And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> expreſſed <hi>patheticke love</hi> to <hi>Jonathan</hi> alwayes, but he was moſt <hi>paſſionate,</hi> when he heard of his <hi>ſlaughter.</hi> The reaſon was, their <hi>love was wonderfull, paſſing the love of women.</hi> Chriſt (O yee ſuffering ſoules!) loves you with a love paſſing the love of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> and the power of this love will

               <p>Conſider him in his offices, of <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> and you will ſee it in all grounds of the point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As <hi>King,</hi> Chriſt is your <hi>King,</hi> and he will be <hi>kinde.</hi> Hee'l neither tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize himſelfe nor ſuffer others. If he doe, hee'l be ſweet and tender, while they be ſwore and tyrannize. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expoſtulates cheerfully with reference to the Churches affliction; thus, <hi>Why haſt thou caſt us off for ever?

Obſerve the Church was bold to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Chriſt to be <hi>kinde,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>King.</hi> Heathen Princes have been very kinde to their ſubjects, eſpecially ſuch as ſuffered in their Wars.

               <p n="3">3. As a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> Chriſt cannot but ſympathize with, and be ſweet unto his people in their ſufferings. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> (in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.) forgat his <hi>office</hi> of Prieſthood, <hi>when he paſſed by on the other ſide,</hi> v. 31. and neither <hi>looked upon,</hi> nor ſhewed kindneſſe to the wounded man; but though he did, Chriſt will not forget himſelfe; but hee'l be <hi>ſacerdotall,</hi> and ſweet to you (O ye wounded ſoules for his ſake) Some thinke, and that groundedly, that the <hi>watchmen</hi> (mentioned, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.7.) were the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church: If ſo, you will ſay, ſurely they were ſtrangely metamorphized; for its ſaid, they did beat and wound the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> v. 7. Its a ſad truth, that ſome that pretend to be in a peculiar manner <hi>Prieſts,</hi> do ſometimes forget themſelves, and turn <hi>perſecutors.</hi> But yet comfort your ſelves with this (beleevers) though they perſecute, Chriſt will be kinde: he is, and will be very ſweet unto you in your ſufferings: And this as your <hi>Prieſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee now the grounds of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102972:95"/>point both <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>particularly:</hi> There is one <hi>ſpeciall</hi> ground in the Text; I will onely adde that, and come to ſome improvement of the point. The <hi>ſpeciall ground</hi> is this, Chriſt is a <hi>Shepherd.</hi> How tender, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the <hi>Shepherd</hi> to, and of all his <hi>flocke,</hi> but eſpecially of ſuch as the <hi>dog hath bit; or the wolfe torne?</hi> What <hi>waſhing</hi> of the wound, what <hi>binding</hi> up of the limb, &amp;c. How haſtily doth he runne to it, and how tenderly doth he drive it, and all becauſe 'tis <hi>hurt.</hi> Chriſt is your <hi>Shepherd</hi> (ſuffering beleevers) and he heares how the <hi>dogs bark and ſnarle</hi> at you; he ſees how they go <hi>about the ſtreets, and about the City, and make a noiſe like a dog</hi> (as 'tis <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.6.) Chriſt obſerves all the goings of the <hi>wolves,</hi> that walke about you, and he takes notice of the <hi>Lyons among whom you lye;</hi> and doubtleſſe hee'l ſee if they <hi>bite</hi> you, and if they doe, hee'l come, and <hi>Shepherd-like,</hi> hee'l be ſweet unto you. Oh that you did but ſee your <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> in your ſufferings! how would that ſight ſupport you? Marke how angry Chriſt is with thoſe <hi>ſhepherds</hi> that did not <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the diſeaſed, nor
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102972:95"/>
                  <hi>healed</hi> that which was ſicke, nor <hi>bound</hi> up that which was broken, nor <hi>brought againe</hi> that which was driven away, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4. And marke moreover, how he ſaith, that in regard of their neglect, <hi>He would ſeek the loſt, bring again that which was driven away, and bind up that which was broken, and ſtrengthen that which was ſick, &amp;c. ibid.</hi> v. 16. O belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers! your <hi>chiefe Shepherd</hi> is, and will be ſweet unto you. Hee'l in all caſes apply himſelfe ſuitably kinde unto you. Hee'l <hi>poure in oyle and wine into all your wounds</hi> (which the <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>wolves</hi> of this world make in your <hi>names, States, perſons,</hi> &amp;c.) Hee'l <hi>waſh and ſupple</hi> them all. Hee'l <hi>kiſſe you with the kiſſes of his lippes.</hi> Hee'l <hi>imbrace</hi> you in his <hi>armes.</hi> In all things, hee'l ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a ſweet Shepherd to you in your ſufferings.</p>

               <p>YOu have now ſeen the point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I deſire it may be improved. Chriſt you heare <hi>is ſweet in his diſpoſition towards, and in his dealing with his ſuffering members.</hi> Will you make theſe uſes of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let this keep you from being over-afraid of ſufferings for Chriſts ſake.</hi> Be not like <hi>Jonah;</hi> ſo to <hi>feare,</hi> as to <hi>flinch</hi> from the worke of Chriſt. You are bid not to <hi>feare the faces of men:</hi> and why ſhould you? For admit they be <hi>cruell,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>kinde:</hi> If they <hi>afflict</hi> you, hee'l <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> you. Sufferings were never <hi>diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious</hi> to Saints, but when <hi>dreaded:</hi> Deſert not the wayes of Chriſt for feare of the <hi>croſſe; Flye</hi> not from him out of <hi>feare</hi> of men. <hi>Sanctifie Chriſt in your hearts, and let him be your feare.</hi> What if <hi>ſufferings</hi> come from men, <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> ſhall come from him. Its a ſhame to ſee it, and a ſorrow to ſpeake of it: Many people for fear of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution flye from the worke of Chriſt.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102972:96"/>They leave the dwellings of <hi>Jacob,</hi> out of dread of <hi>Eſau;</hi> and becauſe they feare the crucifyings of <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſo it is as that they forſake their Saviour. I beſeech you <hi>fence</hi> your heart againſt theſe <hi>feares,</hi> with this truth, <hi>Chriſt is, and will be ſweet to ſuffering Saints.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let this <hi>keep you from ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſufferings:</hi> Chriſt will be ſweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: why ſhould you <hi>ſinke</hi> under that which Chriſt <hi>ſweetens,</hi> though the <hi>thorny crown</hi> prick thy <hi>head,</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt ſhall refreſh thy heart. Its for perſecutors to ſhrinke upon Chriſts <hi>frowns:</hi> The perſecuted may rejoyce, for Chriſt lookes on them with <hi>ſmiles.</hi> Let them ſink in ſorrow that <hi>do evill;</hi> Its for you to ſing with joy, who <hi>ſuffer evill. Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> may <hi>ſing Pſalmes</hi> in priſon, while the <hi>high Prieſt and the Rulers feare the people.</hi> Minde this (ye that ſuffer in any kinde) Jeſus Chriſt uſeth to ſhew much ſweetneſſe to his people in their ſufferings: Do not you therefore ſinke in your ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſweet truth is a <hi>ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe unto thoſe that deale otherwiſe with beleevers under ſufferings then Chriſt doth.</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:102972:97"/>How ready are men to cenſure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that are in troubles, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for Chriſt. O this is your <hi>headineſſe,</hi> your <hi>raſhneſſe,</hi> your <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate,</hi> zeal your being <hi>too forward, &amp;c.</hi> Had you been <hi>ſober,</hi> you ſhould not <hi>ſuffer,</hi> you have brought miſery upon your ſelves: As you <hi>brew,</hi> ſo <hi>drinke,</hi> none doe pity you: eat the fruit of your owne folly, &amp;c. Thus doe ſome deale ſordidly with thoſe, that Chriſt will himſelfe, (and would have us too) deale ſweetly with. O how are theſe to be <hi>reproved:</hi> What for men to be <hi>wifer then Chriſt;</hi> for them to call that <hi>headineſſe,</hi> which the Spirit counts <hi>holineſſe;</hi> for men to <hi>condemne</hi> thoſe as <hi>fooles,</hi> who are ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> as to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> rather them to <hi>ſinne.</hi> And to take <hi>up a croſſe,</hi> rather then not to <hi>follow Chriſt.</hi> Is this to be like unto <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Is this to have the ſpirits of Chriſtians? Nay is not this to be like to the <hi>Jews</hi> who mocked at Chriſt upon the <hi>croſſe,</hi> and gave him <hi>vinegar</hi> and <hi>gall to drinke.</hi> Surely you who <hi>cenſure, ſlight, ſcoffe,</hi> or the like, at the godly, in <hi>priſons,</hi> or <hi>pillories,</hi> or under any ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for Chriſt; you are ſharpely
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102972:97"/>to be blamed, ſeverely to be reproved, for dealing thus <hi>ſordidly</hi> with thoſe, to whom Chriſt is ſo <hi>ſweet:</hi> Its true they are not the <hi>worſe</hi> for this, neither need they to care, but you are the <hi>worſe,</hi> and you need care for being ſo unlike to Chriſt in your carriage.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sith Chriſt is, Oh <hi>let us be alſo ſweet to ſuffering Saints.</hi> Let the ſame diſpoſition be in us, that is in Chriſt, and let us deale with Chriſtians who are in affliction, as he doth. To this end.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us owne them,</hi> why ſhould we be aſhamed of them, whom Chriſt <hi>ownes;</hi> and who <hi>owne</hi> Chriſt ſo much, as that they are not aſhamed to ſuffer for him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nil magis aequum quam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendi à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſule</hi> ſaid <hi>Cicero.</hi> Sure <hi>Nil mag is ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum quam Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di à Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiano.</hi>
                  </note> It ſtands on record as the glory of a good, and great man, that when the Chriſtians were brought to anſwer for themſelves before the Heathen Emperor, he (that was <hi>Vectius Epagathus,</hi>) ſtood up, and demanded to be heard in the defence of the <hi>brethren.</hi> Oh that in ſuffering ſeaſons you would owne ſuffering Saints! Doe not looke away from thoſe that <hi>ſuffer for the teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> 'Twas ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by thoſe that forſooke <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:102972:98"/>when hee was brought before <hi>Nero, 2 Tim.</hi> 4.16. why ſhould we deſert thoſe by whom Chriſt ſtands; let the world know that you <hi>allow</hi> of Chriſts wayes, by <hi>owning</hi> thoſe that ſuffer in them, and for them: Take notice of thoſe that are in <hi>rags</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſake, and let not thoſe who ſuffer for Chriſt, have occaſion to complain that your carriage is not like his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Incourage them,</hi> write letters of <hi>love</hi> to thoſe that are in Baniſhment for the <hi>Lord.</hi> Hearten them by word and writing, that ſtand it out in a ſtorme for truth. <hi>Bleſſe</hi> them as the <hi>beloved of the Lord,</hi> who are the <hi>hatred of the world.</hi> Parents incourage your children, not onely in <hi>well-doing,</hi> but in <hi>evill-ſuffering;</hi> ſay you are glad that ever you begat any, to bleed for Chriſt. Friends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your friends that <hi>do,</hi> &amp; <hi>dye</hi> for the Lord Jeſus: tell them its their <hi>honor to be counted worthy to ſuffer for his name.</hi> While men revile them, doe you praiſe them: and as others ſeek to make them deſert truth, to avoid ſuffering; ſo doe you ſtrengthen them in the truth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuffering. Its <hi>Chriſt-like</hi> to write an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to a <hi>ſuffering,</hi> and a

                  <hi>not-fainting Epheſus:</hi> To write, that you take notice of their <hi>works, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and ſufferings for the Goſpell, &amp;c.</hi> This will be ſweet to them.

But incouragements in ſufferings are <hi>divine,</hi> and to hearten thoſe who <hi>bleed</hi> for Chriſt is very Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sympathiſe with them.</hi> Next to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering our ſelves, is ſympathizing with others. <hi>To rejoyce over the children of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah <hi>in the day of their deſtruction,</hi> is ſordid, and argues the <hi>prophane ſpirit of</hi> Eſau, <hi>Obad.</hi> 12. but to <hi>weep with them that weep,</hi> is ſweet, and it argues the <hi>Spirit of Jeſus.</hi> He was, and we ſhould be perſecuted in the perſecutions of thoſe that ſuffer for his ſake, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4.<note place="margin">

But when he was in</hi> Rome, <hi>he ſought me out very diligently: And in how many things be miniſtred to me at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>thou knoweſt very well,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.16, 17, 18 See how he ſets out the ſweetneſſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> in his carriage to him while he ſuffered, you <hi>communicate</hi> with Martyrs in the glory of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, while you relieve them; and you <hi>doe well</hi> if you do ſo, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.14. all your <hi>ſupplies</hi> that you give, or ſend to ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, are precious <hi>preſents</hi> unto Chriſt: <hi>The things (Paul</hi> ſpeaks of ſupplies ſent him in priſon) were <hi>an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a Sacrifice acceptable, and well-pleaſing unto God,</hi> Phil. 4.19. To pour out of your <hi>bagges</hi> upon thoſe that poure out their <hi>blood</hi> for Chriſt, is a <hi>ſweet ſacrifice:</hi> To give a <hi>cup of conſolation</hi> in reliefe, to thoſe that pledge Chriſt in <hi>the cup of ſuffering,</hi> is a divine <hi>drinke offering;</hi> And as its a

<pb n="893" facs="tcp:102972:101"/>ſhine preſently: he cannot be long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, your <hi>ſins ſhall not,</hi> thinke not then, that your <hi>ſuffering can</hi> ſeperate between him and you, <hi>Why ſayeſt thou,</hi> O Jacob, <hi>and ſpeakeſt, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>my way is hid from the Lord: Haſt thou not heard? haſt thou not knowne the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, he fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not? he giveth power to the faint.</hi> Sing ye ſufferers, rejoyce ye <hi>priſoners of hope!</hi> the Lord whom you <hi>looke for,</hi> and <hi>long after,</hi> he is with you, he cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from you. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in your priſons (though it may be you are <hi>not aware of it.</hi>) However <hi>caſt not away your confidence,</hi> for <hi>be that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. Now the juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> ('Tis ſpoken to ſufferers,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. Live, (Oh live) by <hi>faith,</hi> ye that <hi>dye daily</hi> for the <hi>faith.</hi> In the <hi>faith</hi> of this truth refreſh your ſpirits, <hi>Chriſt is, and will be ſweet in his carriage to ſuffering Saints.</hi> Therefore,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Be ye <hi>incouraged, O beleevers, to bee willing to ſuffer for Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>'tis good to be zealouſly affected alwayes in a good thing:</hi> and in as much as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſeales to this Scripture truth,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102972:102"/>that ſome <hi>have a zeale of God, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge.</hi> Therefore ere I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to preſſe this uſe, I ſhall premiſe this: that foure things are to be wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heeded by all ſuch as expect Chriſts ſweetneſſe in their ſufferings. If you therefore look to experience the truth of this doctrine in your owne ſoules; minde them. You muſt look in all your ſufferings, that

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Looke that your cauſe be good:</hi> Its not for every cauſe that a Chriſtian ſhould ingage unto ſufferings. Neither will Chriſt let forth ſweetneſſe to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſufferer. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a murderer, or as a theife, or as an evill-doer, or as a buſie-body in other mens matters,</hi> 1 Pet 9.15. To ſuffer in theſe or the like caſes, is not <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> neither will it be <hi>comfortable.</hi> Some men ſuffer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as malefactors, then as Martyrs. <hi>To ſuffer, either for diſturbing a States tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, or for endeavouring the introduction, or ſetling a peoples ſlavery, is ſo far from having a Divine, that it wants a morall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:102972:102"/>And certainly ſuch ſufferers have little reaſon to expect Chriſts ſweetneſſe. As ever therefore you would, that in your ſufferings you ſhould be able to ſay Chriſt is ſweet; make ſure of this, that your cauſe be good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>See alſo that your call be clear.</hi> Chriſt calls not all to <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> no more then he doth to <hi>Miniſtery:</hi> The one is a gift, as well as the other. To you its <hi>given</hi> to ſuffer, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. As preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo likewiſe ſuffering without a call will have little comfort. I am perſwaded both the reaſon why ſome have been in the Pulpit without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe by Chriſt, and others have been in the priſon without ſweetneſſe, hath been this, <hi>viz.</hi> want of call. Its true, ſometimes one called to preach, may want ſucceſſe, and alſo one called to ſuffer may not preſently finde comfort (as in godly <hi>Glovers</hi> caſe.) But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly without a call either to the one or the other, a ſoule hath no juſt warrant to expect comfort. As falſe prophets of old, ran before God ſent them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.9. So ſome falſe Martyrs of late, have ſuffered ere Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102972:103"/>them. Be therefore wiſe to cleare your call: If that be ſure, you need not doubt, but Chriſt will bee ſweet. Indeed when truth ſuffers by our ſilence, we are called to ſpeake: And when our life will be Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, we are called to dye. When I am before a Magiſtrate for Chriſts ſake: He then calls me not to be aſhamed of him: And when ſin and ſuffering ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round me ſo, as that I am neceſſitated to take the one, if I will leave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then without doubt I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Chriſt calls me to ſuffering, and that in it, his carriage towards me ſhall be ſweet. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let your carriage be as your Saviours in your ſufferings;</hi> if you'l have his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> let it be <hi>meek:</hi> Its poſſible to be <hi>ſinfull</hi> in ones <hi>carriage,</hi> when one is <hi>righteous</hi> in his <hi>caſe.</hi> And if ſo, its no wonder, if Chriſt be not found <hi>ſweet.</hi> To be feirce and and raging, to raile, and revile in ſuffering hath more of a Beaſt, then a Man: Surely its not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming humanity, and unworthy of Chriſtianity. Chriſtians ſhould be as Lambs in their ſufferings. <hi>Sheepiſhneſſe in this is Saint-ſhip:</hi> Its true the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102972:103"/>rejoyced, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for Chriſts name, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. But they never reviled the powers under which they ſuffered. It becomes Chriſtians to give bleſſings for curſes; all manner of evill ſpeaking is to be put away, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.31. Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call invectives are not becomming Saints, (eſpecially) in ſufferings. Chriſt was a Lamb dumb before the ſhearers, ſo (ſaith the Scripture) opened he not his mouth, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32. Surely the more we have the likeneſſe of his Spirit; the more may we expect the taſtes of his ſweetneſſe, in all our ſufferings for his ſake, and the Goſpels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, eye your end in all your ſufferings. If thy end be either ſelfe or Schiſme, how canſt thou expect Chriſt ſhould be ſweet to thee in thy ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Some have dyed that their names might live. Many I fear venture and act unto ſufferings, rather to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own tenets, then Chriſts truths. <hi>Socrates</hi> dyed to juſtifie that there was but one God; but whether he dyed not for his owne opinion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then for Gods ſake is no great ſcruple. 'Tis ſure one may (I wiſh
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102972:104"/>none did) ſuffer as much for ſelfiſh as ſublime reſpects. Some ſuffer as they doe, <hi>i.e.</hi> for their own glory. A Roman ſpirit can hold to ſuffering and death. An oppoſing ſpirit will put on ſome to dye, rather then to yeeld. The Apoſtle hath left it a cleare thing, that 'tis poſſible to give ones body to be burnt,<note place="margin">

I beſeech you to minde Chriſts glory, truths propagation, the maintenance of equity and righteouſneſſe, in all your ſufferings, if you expect Chriſts ſweetneſſe.</p>
               <p>Having therefore premiſed theſe things, let me onely intreat you to minde them. Indeed it is, and muſt be your wiſdome to ſee your <hi>cauſe be good,</hi> your <hi>call cleare,</hi> your <hi>carriage meek,</hi> your <hi>end right:</hi> And if then, go on, <hi>fear</hi> not, <hi>flinch</hi> not, let ſufferings come <hi>when, where, how</hi> they will, Chriſt is, and will be ſweet unto you in them. But If you <hi>draw back, his ſoule will have no pleaſure in you.</hi> Nor can your ſoules ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any from him. Certainly, if you <hi>draw backe</hi> from <hi>perſecution,</hi> you <hi>draw on to perdition.</hi> Chriſt is not ſo ſweet in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102972:104"/>his dealing with <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but he is as dreadful in his diſcoveries to <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> Aske <hi>Spira,</hi> how dolefull a condition denying is? hee'l tell you, that he <hi>could feel no comfort enter into his heart, and that there is no place there, but onely for torments and bitter vexings of ſpirit.</hi> Hee'l ſadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to you, that he knew that <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be expected by Chriſt, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, to keep his fraile life from adverſity, his wife and children from poverty: But now behold how bitter is this life to me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There is no puniſhment ſo great, but I have deſerved it, for this ſo heynous offence; I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, it is no ſmall matter to deny Chriſt and yet 'tis more ordinary then commonly men doe conceive it, &amp;c.</hi> Well, I beſeech you beloved, take heed of <hi>denying Chriſt,</hi> for feare of ſufferings. 'Tis ſweet to ſuffer for Chriſt, and if you doe, you will finde it ſo. Hee'l (as one ſaid) <hi>pour out love upon the ſoul, when the body pours out blood upon the truth.</hi> But in caſe the ſoule to keep its <hi>blood,</hi> deny Chriſts <hi>truth:</hi> it may (as <hi>Spira</hi> did) wiſh, <hi>O that I might feele, but the leaſt ſenſe of the love of God to me, though but for one ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I now feele his heavy wrath that burnes like the torments of hell within me,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102972:105"/>and afflicts my conſcience with pangs un-ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To winde up all, I beſeech you doe more then thinke, <hi>i.e.</hi> O meditate of theſe things. And let this whole (though little) Tract of Chriſts ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, prevaile with your hearts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to continue in the <hi>fold of</hi> Chriſt. Remember while you are <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt,</hi> you are <hi>without God in the world:</hi> you wander in a wilderneſſe of ſin and ſorrow: you are but (at beſt) among wild-beaſts: you can expect nothing but dangers and devourings. But when once you are returned to the <hi>great ſhepherd of your ſouls;</hi> when once you are brought to, and walke with Chriſt, you are ſafe and ſweet. For if you are <hi>weake,</hi> hee'l <hi>carry</hi> you, and that in his <hi>boſome:</hi> If you <hi>wander</hi> hee'l <hi>gather</hi> you, and that with his <hi>arme,</hi> while you are <hi>lambs</hi> hee'l <hi>carry</hi> you ſafely, and if you are <hi>Ewes great with young, hee'l lead you gently.</hi> Say not, <hi>ſin</hi> is ſweet, and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> bitter, <hi>eaſe</hi> is pleaſant, and <hi>labour</hi> painfull: But know, that if Chriſt take you, into his <hi>Fold,</hi> you will ſay, <hi>ſin is bitter;</hi> and <hi>perſecutions</hi> for his ſake (though unto bloud) are <hi>ſweet,</hi> you
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102972:105"/>will then conclude, the <hi>yoake</hi> of Chriſt is <hi>eaſie,</hi> and his worke is full of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Beleevers, beare witneſſe to this truth: To the reſt I ſay as <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Nathanael, Come and ſee.</hi>
